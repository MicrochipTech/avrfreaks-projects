## Summary

An Atmel AVR ATtiny44 microcontroller is used.


The microcontroller individually modulates the intensity of each of the 24 LEDâ€™s to give a more gentle and pleasing twinkling effect than just blinking on and off.


Principle of Operation


The microcontroller is programmed to generate a pseudorandom sequence of numbers to control the twinkling effect. The 24 LEDâ€™s are arranged in a 6 X 4 pattern and multiplexed by the microcontroller. The intensity of each LED is controlled individually by pulse width modulation. The result is that each LED gently twinkles independently of all other LEDâ€™s.
