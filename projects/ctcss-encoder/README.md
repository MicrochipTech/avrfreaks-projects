## Summary

Some Amateur or CB Radio Repeaters does need a CTCSS Subcarrier to open the transmitter of the Repeater/Transponder Station. Most older Radios doesnÂ´t have this Option built in. This Project generates all the specified CTCSS Subcarrier Frequencies which you can select with a rotary Encoder and the used Carrier is displayed on the LCD (44780 compatible) Also a 1750Hz tone can be generated to open German and other European Repeaters. In the Case of 1750 Hz a Transistor is opened to work with advanced output level because most Repeaters need more level to open at 1750Hz than the one needed by ctcss. (a "H" in the LCD indicates High Level) The generation of the Sub Carrier can switched ON and OFF by pressing the button of the Rotary Encoder.
