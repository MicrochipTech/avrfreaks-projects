## Summary

This idea come out when i was in bed and feel sleepy but my light switch was far from my bed.Then i wondering what if I have a remote to switch that light off. And the idea strike me, why don't i made one for my self. 


In this project I just interface a remote with atmega16. The whole light on/off thing isn't included yet. I'm working on it. Till then...keep in touch.
