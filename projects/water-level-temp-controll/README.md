## Summary

Hello,


This project is build around an ATMEGA32 ï¿½C.  

A Pressuresensor : MPXM2010GS to measure the level.  

A thermocouple to measure the temperature.  

A LCD Display is used the show the measurements.  

To filter (+gain) the signals i have used AD623 instrumentation opamp's.  

The programm contains a lot of info on the 'sideline' & the eagle drawing speaks for himself.


The many many language mistakes are because i don't write that much english tutorials.


This was my first project with avr microcontrollers so if you find something that you would do better please feel free the educate me.  

If there are any more questions you can contact me here:
