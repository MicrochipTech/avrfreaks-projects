*******************************************************

"Instructions for preparing a text file containing strings and numbers that can  be saved to the EEPROM using 'UNO_programmer' and read using the project 'Text_reader'.  
This project contains the subroutines that will be required by user applications.

Only two quotation symbols are allowed in the text file.

Everything ahead of the first quotation symbol is ignored. Every thing ater the second is ignored except decimal and hex numbers.
Hex numbers are preceded by a $ symbol.
Numbers are spaced using space, tab, comma, or line feed characters.

There MUST BE AT LEAST ONE SPACE before the first quotation symbol.


Compose the text strings and save them as a .txt file. The return key is used to terminate each string.
Use Arduino to download 'UNO_programmer' to a UNO board. Connect the target device and open a terminal program.
At the s...s...s...... user prompt press s, e, w, 0 and send the text file when requested.
It may have to be sent several times depending on its size.
At the 'AK' prompt press any key and the file will be echoed to the PC along with the address of each string.
Type the addresss below the second quotation symbol.
One way to do this is to copy the text from the PC into a spreed sheet which separates out the adresses from the strings 
Finally add any other numbers that are to be saved.

This example shows the text strings with the addresses attached."
