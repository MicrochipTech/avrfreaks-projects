Sample text file to be programmed to flash.
It was prepared using a word processor and then copied to notepad.
Note: 
Its is essential that at least one star character is included ahead of the text.
Notepad does not recognise “and” characters.  They must be retyped in notepad.

The UNO pcb plus Atmega328 loaded with the Arduino bootloader: A great combination for getting to grips with the C programming language and microcontrollers. It can also be used as an ISP (in circuit programmer) and used to program other AVR devices.

This posting introduces project "UNO_AVR_programmer", new ISP code for the UNO enabling it to be used to program AVR devices. In addition to uploading hex files and setting the configuration bytes,  text files can also be saved to flash and files containing text and numbers saved to EEPROM.

Two other projects are also included:
"text reader" gives the code necessary to read the text strings one at a time. 
"cal_auto_plus_manual" calibrates the default on-chip oscillator and saves the results to EEPROM.

These projects have been tested on the Atmega 48, 88, 168, 328 and 644 devices.  

 "UNO_AVR_programmer" includes a file into which details of other devices can be entered if required. These details include the signature bytes, memory size, configuration bytes and flash page size.

"UNO_AVR_programmer" is an Arduino project. It has been written specifically for the UNO.  The other projects have been written using Atmel Studio 7.  One of the great strengths of Arduino is that it comes with a bootloader.  With Studio 7 on the other hand it is very easy to select any one from a whole variety of devices.  But an external programmer is then required.  Of course there are many such devices.  It is hoped that this project "UNO_AVR_programmer" will be a useful addition to their number.

It is also hoped that it will encourage new comers to experiment with both systems rather than simply concentrating on one or the other. 

Of course all these projects require a PC interface.  A terminal program is used for this purpose. Several can be downloaded from the web.  My favourite can be found at

But take care to download the version 20130820, other versions may have an issue with the "scroll" button. Settings for the terminal program are: Baud rate: 38400, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit and no handshaking.
