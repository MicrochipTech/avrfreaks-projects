## Summary

This is a programmable thermostat based on an Olimex AVR-MT-128 development board and the Dallas DS18S20 1-wire digital thermostat module. It includes an LCD for displaying the current temperature and setpoints, and the setpoints can be adjusted using the buttons on the development board. The unit can also be connected to a PC using an RS-232 port, and includes Java code for monitoring and controlling the thermostat. The thermostat closes a relay when the temperature gets too high, allowing it to control an air conditioner.
