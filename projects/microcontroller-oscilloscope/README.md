## Summary

A complete oscilloscope is built from a Mega32 and some passive components. The sample rate is a slow 15,750 Hz (video line rate) but is adequate for mains monitoring and electrophysiology. All range and trigger controls are on-screen. There is the ability to dump the trace to a PC. 


A separate version can also produce variable amplitude/duration pulses to act as a physiological stimulator and scope.
