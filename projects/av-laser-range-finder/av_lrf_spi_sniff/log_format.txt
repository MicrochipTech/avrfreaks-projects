each SPI transaction starts from address byte (not specified in log file) and might be from 1 till 16 bytes long.
SPI read transaction not specified in log file too.
Each row in SPI log file is a single SPI transaction.
Each column is value for particular register in device.

For ex.:

1) The following SPI transaction writes 0x5C at address 2, 0xE4 at address 4 and so on...
[90125]:                5C  E4  F4    F0  78  0F  0F    82  10  00  F6  80  3C


2) The following SPI transaction writes 0x10 at address 0x12, 0x01 at address 0x14 and 0xF6 at address 0x16
[90125]:                                                    10  01  F6
