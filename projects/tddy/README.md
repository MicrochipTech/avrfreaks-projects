## Summary

Abstract  

 This document outlines the principle of operation of a digital traffic data display (TDDY) meant to be used in public service vehicles, like public buses, emergency response vehicles, taxi-vehicles (cabs), delivery vehicles and/or similar.


Introduction  

 Collisions between emergency vehicles and other vehicles are common events. Many of these collisions occur at intersections. Public vehicles approaching at 90 degrees to the direction of travel of emergency vehicles are very difficult to see. Using sensors mounted on the vehicle, or in a fixed location near the intersection, or both, in conjunction with two-way radio-transceiver, GPS device or two-way pager could alert emergency vehicle drivers (and other motorists) of approaching traffic (cross traffic). In such a scenario, sensors sends information to some sort of dispatching center which process incoming data and, in return, sends data to interested parties in form of positional information to traffic warning devices mounted in vehicles.  

 This design presents an early implementation of vehicle-mounted receive-only traffic warning device. Conventionally, it uses server software hosted on PC and one-way pager which serves as client to display position of vehicles on city map.
