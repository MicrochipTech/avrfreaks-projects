## Summary

Ages ago we used timer IC's like the famous NE555. Nowadays this is a job for the SOIC8 ATTiny:  

- 3 Volt operation (2x Mignon)  

- Power-down and watchdog  

- Alarm via Speaker  

- Start- and Stop-Button  

- LED  

- nearly no hardware  

Using it as simple tea timer. Therefore put it in an old fashioned tea box (drilled a few holes in). Push the START button and after 5 minutes the speaker sounds (tea is ready).  

Schematic and pictures included.
