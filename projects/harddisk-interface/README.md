## Summary

This project shows how to connect a microcontroller to an IDE harddisk. The microcontroller controls the harddisk and provides a serial interface for connections to other systems. So it is effectively a mass storage that can be accessed via a serial port. 


The project is described in detail on <http://www.heesch.net/avride.aspx> in English and German.
