## Summary

This is external DigitalFrame controller, which learns commands send via IR remote controller to Diital Frame and later transmits code sequence to DigitalFrame after Digital Frame is switvched ON automatically. So it seems like "memory" effect for Digital Frame, it is not necessary to program Digital Frame every time you switch Digital Frame off and on.... it will do it instead of you and will use your last commands sequence you used via IR remote controller !
