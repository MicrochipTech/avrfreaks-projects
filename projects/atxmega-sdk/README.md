## Summary

ATxmega SDK


This SDK will contain drivers and libraries to facilitate future work of programmers for ATxmega microcontrollers in assembly language, this SDK will be for all ATxmega micro-controllers with the suffix A and will be displayed in the image and data may be included in a project as a data field. Assambler real code can not be seen by developers and will not be modified in order to keep intact the integrity of the libraries and drivers.  

Each library and the driver will be described in detail in separate pages on my blog.
