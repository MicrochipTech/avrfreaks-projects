# Flickering Christmas Candle

## Summary

This is a conversion of a 39â€ high General Foam Plastics / Empire Noel Candle to use LEDâ€™s that flicker instead of the original 15 or 25 watt incandescent bulb. The converted candle is about as bright as with the original incandescent bulb.


Blow mold decorations are scarce these days, but I bought 2 candles from <http://paulsoutdoordecorations.com/>, and they are probably available from other sources in the months before Christmas. 


An Atmel AVR ATtiny25 microcontroller is used.


The circuit could be easily adapted to control smaller single LED candles, as well.


The ZIP file includes the source code, schematic diagram and photos.
