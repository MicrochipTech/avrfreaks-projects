## Summary

One general I/O-Pin connected to an RC Lowpass Filter controls an 8-Bit Serial-to-Parallel Converter 74HC(T)164.  

This Circuit can control slow-reacting Devices (such as Relays).LEDÂ´s connected to the Output of the 74HC(T)164 will show some flickering during the shift-process.  

This Code-Example will run on any ATMEL-Processor with a Clock-Frequency up to 8MHz with no change.Faster Clocks requires changes in the Delay-Routine.  

Code is tested with Hardware.
