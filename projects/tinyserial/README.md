## Summary

The Tinyserial library provides basic polling-based serial I/O routines on USART0. It also provides routines for printing constant strings directly from Flash in order to save SRAM. The Tinyserial library is designed to use as little Flash and SRAM as possible, enabling you to fit more complex applications onto your boards.


Although it is coded in assembly, the Tinyserial library respects the GNU libc ABI, so you can call into it from C and C++ programs.
