## Summary

The project mainly focuses on the development and implementation of a serial communication protocol. There are two parts for this purpose: the Software at the PC, and the firmware of the microcontroller, along with the circuitry. A text is entered at the PC end and a 32 character substring of the text is sent via infrared link to the microcontroller. The modulation technique employed is Pulse Duration Modulation for the data, and the character transmission rate for worst case is 18.18 / sec. The firmware supports to checking device ID. Each character sent must have the same device ID with the microcontroller in order to display it in the LCD.
