Graphic LCD such as Clover CM12864b are build on KS0107 and KS0108 chips. KS0107 is capable of interfacing 64x64 pixel LCD, so in order to make 128 x 64 pixel LCD driver, two such ICs are employed. and the selection between them is made through CS1 and CS2 signals. So practically this is two 64 x 64 LCD made in one package.
