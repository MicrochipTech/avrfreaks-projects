# RFM12B on ATTiny26 on 4 wires

## Summary

After reading an article about those nifty RFM12B wireless modules, I decided to buy a few, and start another milestone in my electromagnetic career. After all, with only four wires, how hard could it be to get these modules to work? Wellâ€¦ I hope Iâ€™m not the only one who realized, that a paved surface propels better than a swamp. The modules may be cheap, but without a logic analyzer and only the documentation of the manufacturer to go on, it seemed almost impossible to get them to do, what I wanted. But, in the end I got it right, so now there is a possibility for a (somewhat) reliable radio link between two microcontrollers, using only four ports (the MCUâ€™s SPI interface plus one). Enjoy!
