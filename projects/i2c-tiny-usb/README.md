## Summary

The i2c-tiny-usb is meant to replace those i2c printerport solutions typically used to interface additional i2c client chips like e.g. thermo sensors to the PC. 


The i2c-tiny-usb interface was designed for use with Linux. While the hardware bridges between usb and i2c it comes with a Linux kernel driver doing the same thing on the software side. This makes the entire setup transparent to existing Linux client software like lm-sensors.
