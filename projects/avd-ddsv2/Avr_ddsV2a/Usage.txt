Quick Use Guide for AVR_DDS
---------------------------
R = Re-Init AVR-DDS (default 1KHz and Sine)
S = Set new frequency, enter 6 digits
1 = Select Sine Wave
2 = Select Square Wave
3 = Select Triangle Wave
4 = Select Random Wave
+ = +1Hz
- = -1Hz
D = +10Hz
d = -10Hz
C = +100Hz
c = -100Hz
K = +1KHz
k = -1KHz

Any other key spits out the current frequecy.

Note: With 10MHz oscilator, max frequency is 500KHz using square wave output.
