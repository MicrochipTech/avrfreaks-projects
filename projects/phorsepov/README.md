## Summary

PhorsePOV is a simple POV gadget which uses a single button to enter messages in Phorse code (a variation of Morse code centred around a phone keypad layout to make it easy to learn and remember). It's based around an ATTINY25 AVR running from its internal RC powered by a Lithium coin cell strapped to the back.


The attached files contain the Stripboard circuit as a stripes file; a PhorsePOV guide pdf; the source code and the binaries for version 0.91, which can be built using a make tool and a command-line compiler.
