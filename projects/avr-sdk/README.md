## Summary

Hello everyone,


I am currently developing a SDK for AVR microcontrollers, and not only in a solitary way.  

The project has a target that ranges from those who are less experienced to the professional. With this project, those who know little to nothing will be able to study from the documents inside it. The user will then be able to train  and solve problems related to both the SDK and  microcontrollers.


Currently supporting microcontrollers of the ATmega family: atmega328p, atmega2560.


The project aims to support ARM in the near future.


The project can be accessed at: <https://github.com/Yanujz/AVR_SDK>


Given the huge amount of work behind it, I'm looking for someone to help me out and develop this project.


I want to clarify that the project is open and aims to simplify embedded programming. Let me know if you are interested!
