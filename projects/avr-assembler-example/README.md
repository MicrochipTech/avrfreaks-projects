## Summary

While moving from Arduino IDE C to assembler, we've documented some of the code and projects along the way. We thought some others might get some use from the journey and so the link to the resultant document is provided here. The link is to the most recent version of the project and will be updated as required. Feedback and suggestions welcome!
