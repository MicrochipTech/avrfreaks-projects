# Mutli-program serial bootloader

Uploaded by rollebollen on 2013-04-03 15:23:00 (rating 0 out of 5)

## Summary

Tested with ATMega644. Enables programming and running multiple programs, by splitting the flash into two banks; one for the active application and one storage area for the programs. Supports programming via serial interface.


Could be useful if you write a lot of test programs that you do not change to often, and want a fast way to switch between them.
