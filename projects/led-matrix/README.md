Uploaded by marc*s on 2008-06-23 18:04:00 (rating 0 out of 5)

## Summary

- Each of the 48 LED's is dimmable by 32 Steps  

- Controlled by I2C Interface (Software Slave)  

- A few selectable modes, like: speed controlled fluent, or spontaneous transition, display e2prom-stored bitmaps...


The LED matrix provides a bright and multi coloured light. It can be controlled by a standard I2C-Interface. Note that it's done without an interrupt, so the transferrate shouldn't by higher than 30Kbs.


The hardware is based on an old fashioned AT90s8515 - it was the only one with a PLCC that i had. But it's really simple to insert a modern type.


The comments are written in german. If you have any questions i'll try to answer in ,broken' english - Sorry !
