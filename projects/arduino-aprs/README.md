## Summary

Automatic Packet Reporting System (APRS) is an amateur radio-based system for real time tactical digital communications of information of immediate value in the local area.


In its most widely used form, APRS is transported over the AX.25 protocol using 1200 baud Bell 202 audio frequency-shift keying (AFSK) on frequencies located within the amateur 2-meter band.


The messages are usually relayed via radio to internet connected stations that send the data to the APRS-IS network.


The purpose of this project is to implement an APRS tracker using an Arduino 2009.


This device can be used to periodically send a message through a radio AFSK channel and log the received messages to a serial port (UART).


Note: currently I'm unable to add files to the project. However, you can reach project home page + schematics here:
