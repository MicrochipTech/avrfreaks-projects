## Summary

In this project,


Main Idea is to develop wireless connectivity to the Energy Meter available at the home.  

By means of the we can have Remote collection of Energy Data,Multi rate Tariff,Prepaid billing,energy theft Prevention,VAS like Messaging,Controlling device Remotely etc.


And for this first step is to design Energy Meter which can measure energy consume through 230 v,50 Hz,Single phase,two wire line.It should also be able to measure parameter like Active Energy, RMS value,Apparent power,Reactive power,Power Factor,waveform of the V & I,Remote control of Devices,Security Event Messaging etc.


Energy Meter can be design in two measure ways,


One way is to use exiting Analog Front End IC like CS5464,ADE7753 etc which will give this all value through SPI interface.


Other Way is to use existing ADC on the At mega Microcontroller for measurement of the Energy which will be less costlier but need to take great care in design and development.


Once we have Energy value and other different parameters in hand,we can use Zigbee Smart Energy Profiles to transmit it to the coordinator which is connected with Internet and hence this value can reach to central server.


this value can be measured periodically which may be helpful to analyze power quality,Billing information,energy management,Dynamic load management,enhanced customer quality services
