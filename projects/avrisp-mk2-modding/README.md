## Summary

go here:  

<http://webx.dk/avrisp-mk2-modding/>


see the pictures, they talk for them self.  

the LM317 uses 5V USB power as input, 220 Ohm and 300 Ohm to make 3V.  

The jumper can select: 3V or 5V or none as normal.  

now you can power you small targets directly from USB power,  

normaly no problem is you use under 100mA,  

well one AVR running at 8Mhz uses way under 10mA
