## Summary


```

See my github.
https://github.com/glscantlen/instructions/tree/master/arduino\_uno\_garage\_door\_opener

This folder contains instructions developed from notes taken during
the repair of my garage door opener. I have a Geni 1/2HP screw drive
garage door opener that failed several years ago. It was time over
due to repare or replace it and save my back of strain from opening
the door manually. As most engineers; I first belived I can repair
the opener. This README is a summery of how I repaired the door
opener using an Arduino UNO. The "opener.ins" in this folder will
detail the software procedures I used.
