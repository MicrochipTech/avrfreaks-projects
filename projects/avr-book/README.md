## Summary

Abstract  

The goal of this book is to support embedded folks with information to  

develope applications with the AVR microcontroller family. The main  

philosophy is the learning by doing approach.


Chapter 2 explains the necessary equipment to do the“ learning by doing“ part of this compendium.


Chapter 3 is a quick start guide where a first C programm is written on the pc then transmitted into the microcontroller and tested in the self assembled hardware.


Chapter 4 is about the basics of microcontroller. On the other hand themes like human to machine interfaces, circuitry and pin-safe-techniques are also described.


Chapter 5 introduces the software development process for the programming  

language C. This chapter can also used as reference work for C. Because of the special working environment the main focus is set on the microcontroller as development target.


Chapter 6 gives an overview about available software-libraries. The usage and possibilities are shown in detail.


Chapter 7 is about debugging and failure searching methods.


Chapter 8 is the „learning by doing“ section where a lot of projects are  

described. Therefore active work is required. But be careful because making embedded systems work may cause addiction.


Chapter 9 is a collection of solution for recuring problems. With circuits, code snippets and whole project descriptions solutions are provided.


Chapter 10 leads into the topic of real time operating systems (rtos). To show the usage in a more practical manner a small project is realised with a free available real time os.


Chapter 11 is the FAQ section of this comprisal where you can find answers to frequently asked questions.


Chapter 12 covers different number systems like the binary system and how to use them in the field of microcontrollers.


Chapter 13 is the tools section of the AVR-Kompendium where helpful tools  

are presented.


In Chapter 14 the attentive reader is invited to do a small test where each can get an overview about the own „embedded microntroller“ knowledge. The test covers software and hardware issues.
