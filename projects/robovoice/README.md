## Summary

The AVR-microcontroller is used as a digital signal processor (DSP).  

Reverberation, ringmodulation and vibrato sound-effects are implemented in the microcontroller. Using these effects, you can generate robot-like voice. All effects were first tested in Matlab (code included). Soundsamples of the microcontroller are also included in the package. If you expect high quality audio, you may be disappointed. You can't do miracles with this small a microcontroller.  

The extra hardware needed consists of an anti-alias filter, a reconstruction filter and an R-2R-ladded-DAC.


It's an ideal project for people who want to get acquainted to sound processing without having to study loads of complicated C++ code.
