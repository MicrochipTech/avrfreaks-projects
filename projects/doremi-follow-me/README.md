## Summary

Based on an idea found on the internet a long time ago (by Mr. Dhananjay V. Gadre) this is a small music toy. It plays a sequence of notes (starting from 1) and waits for response. If you succeed it plays 2 notes etc. An easy to build project, working from 2002 until now and still love it...
