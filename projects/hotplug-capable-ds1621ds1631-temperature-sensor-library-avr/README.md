# A hotplug-capable DS1621/DS1631 temperature sensor library for the AVR

## Summary

Hello everyone,


to compensate for my crappy hardware setups I decided to create a DS1621/DS1631 library that is hotplug-capable.


Main features are:


* supports hot-plugging
* supports up to 8 sensors
* reads count\_remain and slope registers for higher accuracy
* supports negative temperature values
* uses the AVRs hardware TWI-interface

Â 


I hope It's useful for someone out there.
