## Summary

[FreeRTOS](http://www.FreeRTOS.org) is a [market leading](http://bit.ly/mJ0NVF) real time operating system (or [RTOS](http://www.freertos.org/about-RTOS.html)) from [Real Time Engineers Ltd.](http://www.freertos.org/RTOS-contact-and-support.html) that supports 33 architectures and receives 103000 downloads a year. It is professionally developed, strictly quality controlled, robust, [supported](http://www.freertos.org/FreeRTOS_Support_Forum_Archive/freertos_support_forum_archive_index.html), and [free to use in commercial](http://www.freertos.org/a00114.html) products without any requirement to expose your proprietary source code.


See: [The FreeRTOS value proposition . . .](http://www.freertos.org/RTOS.html) 


FreeRTOS V7.4.2 includes [FreeRTOS+FAT SL](http://www.FreeRTOS.org/fat_sl), a market proven, DOS compatible, proprietary and supported FAT file system provided by HCC Embedded to Real Time Engineers Ltd for use with FreeRTOS or in bare metal systems (without an RTOS). FreeRTOS+FAT SL is intricately engineered to minimise both Flash and RAM footprint, allowing the same code base to be used across a wide range of 8, 16 and 32-bit MCUs. Its small Flash and RAM footprint, and its ability to be used without an RTOS, make it particularly suitable for use on AVR microcontrollers. FreeRTOS+FAT SL is distributed under a dual pure GPL (unlike the modified GPL under which FreeRTOS is distributed) and commercial license.
