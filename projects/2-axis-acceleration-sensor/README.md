# 2 axis acceleration sensor

Uploaded by wizardhobo on 2008-04-21 17:38:00 (rating 0 out of 5)

## Summary

The ADXL202 is a 2 axis acceleration sensor with pulse width modulated outputs. With the aid of an ATtiny2313 and this program those outputs are converted to a stream of 16bit acceleration values scaled between +1.0 and -1.0 on the UART port.  

Explanation of the code and the design choices made are included in comments.


A schematic is not included because connecting an ADXL202 to a tiny2313 is pretty straightforward (pin/port assignments are given in the code).
