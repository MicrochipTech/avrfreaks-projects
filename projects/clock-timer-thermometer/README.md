## Summary

DIGITAL CLOCK WITH TIMER & THERMOMETER


This project was actually designed to automatically switch on & switch off the garden sprinklers. This is basically a clock with control over the duration of alarm(on & off time) so it doubles as a timer too. The on and off time of the alarm can be set using the push buttons .When the clock reaches the â€˜alarm onâ€™ time the relay gets activated and it is deactivated when the clock reaches the â€˜alarm offâ€™ time.
