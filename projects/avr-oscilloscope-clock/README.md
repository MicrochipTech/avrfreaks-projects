## Summary

The [Dutchtronix AVR Oscilloscope Clock V3.0](http://www.oscilloscopeclock.com):  
  
  

The [Dutchtronix AVR Oscilloscope Clock](http://www.oscilloscopeclock.com) is a simple board containing an ATmega168 microcontroller, a PCF8563 Real Time Clock with separate crystal and a TLC7528 Digital to Analog Converter. This board, together with the Open Source V3 Clock firmware converts your existing (analog) oscilloscope into a very flexible clock. Besides the many display options, it is also possible to connect a GPS device to the Oscilloscope Clock, both the NMEA character output as well as the 1 Pulse Per Second signal. The board contains a backup battery and an RS-232 level converter. The ATmega168 microcontroller comes preloaded with both the V3.0 clock firmware as well as a boot-loader. This boot-loader allows the user to update or change the firmware using the serial port of a PC.


The newly released V3 firmware provides a host of features such as:


* Display Time as an analog 12 hr, 24 hr or Roman Numerals Clock
* Display Time and Date in Numeric mode
* Set Time and Date using the on-board button switch
* Set clock options and modes with On Screen Menu using the push button switch
* Binary Clock Display option
* Optional Hexadecimal Numeric Display
* Fractional Seconds display option showing time in 1/100 of a second increments
* A total of 30 different Clock Display combinations is possible
* Optionally add your own name to the Clock Display
* Automatic Time and Date setting when connected to the NMEA output from a GPS device
* Automatic Daylight Saving Time correction for the years 2008-2014 for the USA and the EU
* Automatic Screen Repositioning to prevent screen burn-in
* Display Calibration mode
* Play modes to have some fun with the clock
* Clean Reset of the EEProm Configuration Data option
* Built-in Demo mode to show some of the clock features
* Alternate Open Source Application available: [the AVR Oscilloscope Terminal](http://www.dutchtronix.com/ScopeTerm.htm)
* Extensive FAQ document available on the Dutchtronix website:  [www.dutchtronix.com/ScopeClock3-0faq.htm](http://www.dutchtronix.com/ScopeClock3-0faq.htm)

Hardware features are:


* Professionally made dual sided PCB (with solder masks and silkscreen)
* Connects to your analog scope in X-Y mode using regular 10x probes
* Only 5V Power required (clock side cable connector included)
* RS-232 serial control connection (use is optional, clock side cable connector included)
* On-board Real-Time Clock IC with 32.768kHz crystal and battery backup
* Firmware pre-programmed and upgradeable through the RS-232 interface using the built-in boot loader
* 200-290 Hz Screen Refresh rate (dependent on the selected clock face mode)
* On board LED and push button switch
* Intensity Control Output
* Header for External Clock Signal (GPS 1 Pulse Per Second for example)
* Complete kit available, including connectors for the 5V power and optional Serial cable
