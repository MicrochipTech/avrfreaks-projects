The Dutchtronix AVR Oscilloscope Clock V3.0:

Website: www.dutchtronix.com/ScopeClock.htm

The Dutchtronix AVR Oscilloscope Clock is a simple board containing an ATmega168 microcontroller, a PCF8563 Real Time Clock with  separate crystal and a TLC7528 Digital to Analog Converter. This board, together with the Open Source V3 Clock firmware converts your existing (analog) oscilloscope into a very flexible clock. Besides the many display options, it is also possible to connect a GPS device to the Oscilloscope Clock, both the NMEA character output as well as the 1 Pulse Per Second signal. The board also contains a backup battery and an RS-232 serial converter. The ATmega168 microcontroller comes preloaded with both the V3.0 clock firmware as well as a boot-loader. This boot-loader allows the user to update or change the firmware using the serial port of a PC.

The newly released V3 firmware provides a host of features such as:

Display Time as an analog 12 hr, 24 hr or Roman Numerals Clock
Display Time and Date in Numeric mode
Set Time and Date using the on-board button switch
Set clock options and modes with On Screen Menu using the push button switch
Binary Clock Display option.
Optional Hexadecimal Numeric Display
Fractional Seconds display option showing time in 1/100 of a second increments.
A total of 30 different Clock Display combinations is possible.
Optionally add your own name to the Clock Display
Automatic Time and Date setting when connected to the NMEA output from a GPS device
Automatic Daylight Saving Time correction for the years 2008-2014 for the USA and the EU
Header for External Clock Signal (GPS 1 Pulse Per Second for example)
Automatic Screen Repositioning to prevent screen burn-in
Display Calibration mode
Intensity Control Output
Play modes to have some fun with the clock.
Clean Reset of the EEProm Configuration Data option
Built-in Demo mode to show some the clock features
Alternate Open Source Application available: the AVR Oscilloscope Terminal
Extensive FAQ document available on the Dutchtronix website: www.dutchtronix.com/ScopeClock3-0faq.htm
