## Summary

Read and Write EEPROM with I2C protocol using an AtMega48 using TWI module. In the sample i'd used an 24LC256 by microchip but i think that you can read or write any other eeprom with I2C bus. Look at EEPROM datasheet for I2C address.


Added routine for send data eeprom to pc by rs232 useful for dumping eeprom
