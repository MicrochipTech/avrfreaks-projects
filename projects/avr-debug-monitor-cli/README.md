## Summary

This AVR Debug Monitor is a complete stand-alone program with a full-featured command-line user interface (CLI). The program makes a good starting point for the development of application firmware for the ATmega128 and similar 8-bit AVR processors. Code size is under 8KB. A target-resident debug facility is particularly useful if you don't have access to a hardware debugging tool such as the JTAG ICE.
