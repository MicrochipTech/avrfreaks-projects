## Summary

A complete (?) project for a basic 7-segment LED clock. Even though there are many such available, I wanted to try my own hand at a full project, from concept to completion. This is what I came up with. I'm looking for some constructive feedback on this. I have no doubt that a professional would probably shudder over my work, so please keep in mind that I'm just a hobbyist :)
