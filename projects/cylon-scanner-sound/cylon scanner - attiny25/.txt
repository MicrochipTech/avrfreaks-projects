# The speaker is a standard 8 Ohm... speaker ;)

# All the LEDs are standard brightness red ones

# The power source MUST be 5V, or else the transistor used will not toggle at all!
  It is probable that a BJT transistor could be used, but then the filter should be
  a passive RL one. BJT transistors require more current than the LC filter can output.

# There are no current limiting resistors for the LEDs and they are stressed a lot.
  Other LEDs could be used, but the classic RED ones seem to tollerate this kind of (ab)use.
