## Summary

A Cylon (the mean androids from BattleStar Galactica) scanner with 12 LEDs, charlieplexed on 4 pins of the ATtiny 25. The sound is produced with PWM and resembles the buzz of Cylons. The code was writtend in assembly for the WinAVR assembler. The zip file contains the source code and the binary (HEX file), along with some notes and the schematic... Have fun!


PS: You can see it in action in a (funny) video here:
