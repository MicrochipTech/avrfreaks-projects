## Summary

This program copies the 20 bytes of character data from the program memory to the SRAM and sends to the PC by means of USART and displays on the Hyperterminal screen upon external interrupt request.


 I used two external interrupts triggered by switches  

 SW0 : to display the text on the hypher terminal  

 SW1 : to light on and off eight leds
