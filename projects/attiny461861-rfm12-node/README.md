## Summary

Small PCB design using ATtiny 461/861 for RF linked remote temperature sensor with 1-wire sensor.  

Well suited for battery operation as most of the time is spent in sleep mode.  

Choose from multiple data-rates and RF channels.


I have several of these around (in and outside) my house. One sensor in my freezer (I always wondered what the temp was in there).  

The data is collated, stored on a SD card in an Arduino system and logged on the internet.


These are only used as transmitters, the receive side should also work fine but is untested.  

There are 4 other available I/O's on the PCB which can read analog or be used as digital I/O.
