## Summary

Many times I have needed a tool during development of a project where I wanted to test out an interface (motor, LCD, etc). You can purchase IO plug in boards or USB-IO boards for your computer for > $100. But I decided that I should be able to easily design my own. "avr\_io" is code that turns the AVR into a PC controlled IO device. Commands are sent using an RS232 link. Any register of the AVR can be written or read. I have used it to evaluate LCD modules and stepper motors. [http://home.att.net/~steven.nick...](http://home.att.net/~steven.nickels/)
