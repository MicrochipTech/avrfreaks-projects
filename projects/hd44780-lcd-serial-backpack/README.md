## Summary

The My\_LCD controller uses the ATtiny2313 as an RS232 based serial Pass-thru controller that provides power up initialization and establishes the necessary timing for the HD44780 text based LCD controller chipset. In addition, the ATtiny2313 firmware controls an optional LED backlight.
