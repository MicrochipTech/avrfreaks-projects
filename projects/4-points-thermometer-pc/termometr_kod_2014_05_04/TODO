- move temperature labels to EEPROM instead of being hardcoded.
- DELTA calculations, (partially done - column)
- separate output for LCD and serial (no deltas on serial), (partially)
- add commas in serial output, (done)
- buzzer stuff, (almost)

- encoder -> timers, 

- add "def_LCD_char" especially degrees Celsius.

- correct the BUG in init sequence when EEPROM is factory fresh -> "num_of_sensors" = &ff.

- corrected, done DELTAs

- rewrite keyboard filtering, 
- made alarm for ABS(COLUMN_DELTA) > 0.15deg
- added commas in serial output
2014-04-13
- rewrite keyboard usage in CONFIG mode to use soft keys, 
- COLUMN temp (for now) on serial is always absolute, regardeless of "delta" setting, 
- have to replicate this behavior for head too.
