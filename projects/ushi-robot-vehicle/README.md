## Summary

Ushi is a project from the Ushi working group of the Dutch Forth Chapter. It is designed around three printed circuit boards and uses a AT90S2313 controller, it is possible to fit a AT90S4433, ATmega8, or ATmega16/32 using a small add on board. Other hardware: IR-receiver/transmitter, floor sensors, and wheel rotation sensors.

The basic software is a BIOS for Ushi's standard hardware and  

the basic application is Ushi as in infrared controlled (RC5)  

robot with a selfcontrol function where Ushi will not fall from  

a table and avoid objects on the table with use of a GP2D02.


Additional software:  

- On the floor drawing with penlift, Ushi writes it's own name as a demo.  

- Line maze solving robot, Ushi solves a rectangular line maze and  

sends the ongoing work and result back to a PC using the IR-transmitter.  

- Ushi as a table cleaner, There ushi scan's for cups on the table  

and removes them by pushing them over the edge.
