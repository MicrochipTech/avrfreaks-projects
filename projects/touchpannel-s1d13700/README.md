## Summary

My project is to make a device which should be used by its touch screen.  

Ther is only one hardware button for switching it on and off.  

All other function and parameters should be changed by using the touch screen.


Graphic LCD 320x240 pixel module 240320G with touchscreen from displaytech  

Here the discription about reading touch positions from a resistive touch screen.  

The LCD Module has a built in controller from TI S1D13700 which has some nice functions like separate layers and 4 bit gray scale


At the moment the touch screen and writing LCD module is working
