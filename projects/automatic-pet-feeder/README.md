## Summary

Sorry for this online translation:


This distributor enables me to go away one or two days by leaving my dwarf rabbit only to the house. Four small amounts of food (granulets dry) rock in turn in a funnel prolonged by a PVC tube to the small mess tin, at preselected hours and days. Such which it is programmed here, it makes rock the first proportions the evening of the first day (the morning I manually give to eat before leaving), the second proportions the morning of the second day, the third the evening of the second day and the fourth the morning of the third day. I must return at the latest before the evening of the third day. Of what thus to spend three days and two nights consecutive out of at home, while envisaging of course to provide sufficiently to drinking for this duration.


It would be possible to design a distributor for one longer duration, but I disadvise it highly parce that to leave to only sound small companion longer holds of the ill-treatment towards the animals.


I supply this apparatus with a small battery 12V and not by the sector in order to avoid a big problem in case of interruption of current.  

I already used it punctually and it gave me whole satisfaction (thus apparently that in Fripounette) but I plan to install in parallel a remote monitoring by webcam so much I were distressed during my escapades.
