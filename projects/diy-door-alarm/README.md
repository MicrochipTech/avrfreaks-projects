## Summary

AvrStudio 6.1  

ATTiny861A


Maybe it is much easier ways to do simple door alarm system, but I did it like this because of PWMs driven RGB-LEDs and adjustable alarm delay. Attiny reads ADC information from sensor board and if door is opened, sounding alarm after delay. 


System consist of two boards, main board and sensor board. In my project, distance between boards is ~30m. Boards are connected together with two wire cable.


Note! You can use it with any ON/OFF information as you want. Door, window, locker etc. Only choose your own alarm switch type.


Look at project pages in wauwau.webs.com.
