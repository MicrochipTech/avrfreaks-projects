## Summary

Sept 12, 2003: Just noticed for some reason my files were gone from this thing, so just re-uploaded them today. Sorry about that!


Jan 20, 2003: Changed the .doc files to .pdf so everyone should be able to read them, and it greatly reduces file sizes


This project controlled a hovercraft with an artificial neural network. This project has some fun with a few AVR's, and should be useful if your interested in anything here:  

-using artificial neural networks  

-controlling a hovercraft  

-speed control  

-ultrasonic rangefinding (SONAR ish)


This was an entry into the IISEF 2002 (Intel International Science and Engineering Fair), which is why there is a fair amount of documentation with this project.


be SURE to read the README.TXT file!
