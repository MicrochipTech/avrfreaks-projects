renumber utility

-> for linux; under "linux", use "renumber" or "renumber.sh"
-> for windows; under "windows", use "renumber.exe"

Caveat:
1)  All program lines MUST start with a line number.

2)  Be sure the source file is WINDOWS format with CR/LF combination
    or else the utility chokes!  
3)  No extra lines at then end of the file or in between program lines.
