Uploaded by cassidento on 2014-04-02 01:44:00 (rating 0 out of 5)

## Summary

There are many possible reset sources, such as power-on, BOD, reset pin, WDT. This code will wait 2 seconds after a reset and then repeatedly pulse a GPIO to indicate what the reset source was. Works with ATtiny13A and ATtiny25 / 45 / 85 using #ifdef to identify the compilation target and adjusting the register names, etc. Studio 6.1 update 2.
