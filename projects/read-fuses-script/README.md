# read-fuses script

## Summary

read-fuses is a quick perl script I wrote to display the fuse settings for a ATtiny2313 in a human readable format. I wrote this because I was constantly referring back to the datasheet to decode the fuse bytes.


The script is meant to be used in a shell/Makefile environment that has avrdude. It should be usable in both Linux and Windows (using WinAVR). It was developed in a WinAVR + Cygwin environment, but there shouldn't be any reason why it shouldn't (or could be made to) run on other platforms.


For more info, please see the included README file, and please let me know of any bugs or suggestions for improvement.


(Note: I'm having trouble uploading project files, so for now the script s available at <http://rantapaa.phpwebhosting.com/avr/>)
