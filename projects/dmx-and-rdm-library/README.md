# DMX and RDM library

Uploaded by mathertel on 2013-03-09 08:58:00 (rating 0 out of 5)

## Summary

The DMXSerial library was designed to send and receive DMX data packets. Now it is extended to support RDM packets as well. I had to overcome several pitfalls and stumbling blocks while extending the DMXSerial implementation and I will keep the current version because it needs only a very small amount of program data.


The RDM extended version will be DMXSerial2. 


What you can find in the zip file on my site is an ARDUINO project including all the files you need to compile.
