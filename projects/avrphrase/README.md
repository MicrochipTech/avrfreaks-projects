## Summary

AVRphrase is an AVR based word game that plays like Catchphrase by Hasbro. I got the idea to do this project because my family really enjoys playing Catchphrase, but the wordlist is too complex for some of the younger nephews. The game I created holds 4000 words/phrases and the end user can completely customize the wordlists using a simple uploader I wrote in Processing.
