# Servo driven robotic gripper

## Summary

I started this project to play with a Sharp GP2D12 IR analog sensor and to allow MCU control of a robotic gripper I built (versus RC control). I started with code snippets from various sources and glued several pieces together the way I wanted them to fit. 


I hope this project provides a jumping off point for others, I'm releasing it to the public domain to do with it as it pleases. Big thanks to emilevanderlaan as his was the basis for the servo code. And to Brian of bdmicro.com for his code samples.


NOTE ... WARNING ... I drew my ISP connector as a 2x5 (10-pin header) but it is wired for the 6-pin ISP connector. The extra pins are Vcc and GND. To be honest I didn't use this connector for programming but for hardware debugging with an o-scope.
