## Summary

AVR Microcontroller + PIR Sensor + LED Matrix Board = Motion Activated Message Display


The idea of this project is to make an electronic moving display system that is activated by movements in its surroundings. It can be placed in commercial establishments and it can be used to greet or welcome people who pass by. The motion triggering system means that the display is inactive if there is no motion (or if there is no people around). Therefore, this consumes less power than those electronic moving display system without the motion trigerring system.
