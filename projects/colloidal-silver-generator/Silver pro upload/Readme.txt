This is the Silver pro,

This is one of the best Ionic colloidal silver generators to ever be made, it is now being released by me, for your own private use.  You are not allowed to build and sell these units, you may however help your friends to build theirs and charge a small fee for the labor. In other words I don't want you to profit from my hard work.

I have not released the source code for the firmware as of yet, but I have released the hex code for the unit.  I may release the source code for it later though.



By using any part of this, you are agreeing that you will not use this information for profit or use it in a commercial way what so ever.








Breakdown of this folder,

Cnc Files: 
Files that were used by me to create this project on a cnc routing machine.
it contains all of the files need to complete the 2 double sided boards and the case.
note: only the labling, and all holes for the case were done on the cnc, the case was purchased.

Firmware: 
The Firmware for the ATMEG8 that is used in this project.

Project Pics:
Pictures of the project as It was assembled.

Upper_Board, Lower_board:
schematics of the upper and lower boards, in Png format.



Notes: In my design, I used two double sided boards, but would be very easy to complete this
project using perfboard and point to point wiring.

This design will bring you years of reliable service, I have used it for almost 3 years now with
not one problem thus far.  And it makes very nice ionic coloidal silver.
a quick link to the page: http://www.silverfolk.com/SilverProAdvanced.html
if you would like to get a quick rundown of what your embarking on here.

I will need to write up a user manual for it, had one written, but somehow got deleted :( 
I will place this up on the forums for everybody to download. 


Good luck with your new colloidal silver generator, may it keep you fit for life.
