## Summary

 Computer controlled as name specifies a robot that can be handled using computer.Here i've used the concept of UART (universal asynchronous receiver and transmitter).Through UART i have entered some program specified characters to microcontroller and accordingly it moves i.e. either forward,left,right or stops. The character which we have sent should get display on computer for our convenience so we have used a software DOCKLIGHT.It's very simple robot and can be used as compter controlled line follower.
