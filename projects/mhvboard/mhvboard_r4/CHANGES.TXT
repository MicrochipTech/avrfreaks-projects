MHV Revision 4 2010-10-01
	Tidied silkscreen
	Removed ICSP2 (the board can no longer function single-sided
		use revision 3 if you cannot fabricate a double sided board)
	Added a power LED
	Fixed header spacing for Arduino shield compatibility
	Added pin header for breadboard interfacing
	Board relaid out from scratch
	Extended JP8 to add reset for greater shield compatibility
	Marked LED polarity on the silkscreen

MHV Revision 3 2010-09-16
	Added a solder to disable the LED
	Change clock crystal to 20MHz

MHV Revision 2 2010-08-26
	Added standard ICSP for use on double sided boards
	Added 3mm LED on pin 13 for use on double sided boards
	Changed prototype area to pads only on the bottom layer

MHV Revision 1 2010-08-25
	Added TTL Serial
	Added ICSP
	Widened power traces
	Replaced USB B connector with mini-USB B
	Replaced DC jack with one with wider holes

Metaboard Release 1.0 2008-03-26
	Added Solder Jumpers so that the assignment of USB D+ and D- to AVR port
	pins D2 and D4 can be swapped. The default is still D+ on D2 (INT0) and
	D- on D4 and the default tracks must be cut in order to swap the
	assignment. D- on INT0 is of advantage for implementing USB suspend mode
	and to keep the internal RC oscillator in sync with the USB frame clock.

Metaboard Release 0.0
	Changed routing so that signal tracks don't come so close to the board
	dimension.
	Allow 100 nF capacitor in 2.5 mm or 5 mm grid.
