## Summary

It's getting more and more difficult to backup those precious old c64 disks. For various years the only solution was to use some very timing critical printer port cable to connect an original vc1541 disk drive to a modern PC. Unfortunately these solutions turned out to be cumbersome since they have problems with the various printer port hardware out there. Furthermore modern multitasking operating systems make such an approach even more difficult causing some of the necessary programs to still be DOS based.


The xu1541 solves this problem by using an Atmel AVR to interface between the vc1541 cbm iec bus and USB. It's thus possible to use the xu1541 to backup your precious old c64 disks on any USB equipped PC.


Currently desktop software exists for Linux, but Windows as well as MacOS versions are on their way.
