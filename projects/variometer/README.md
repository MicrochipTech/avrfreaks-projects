## Summary

Measurement is done with an 24Bit serial ADC connected to the output of an pressure sensor. Sensitivity is aprox. 20cm/s to 5m/sec vertical speed, with the Software it ist also possible to calculate the relative height above the starting point. Output of the vertical speed is done via variable frequency, generated with Timer1 output toggle, and send to the pilot via 433 Mhz ISM transmitter. A increase in frequency indicates a positive vertical speed, a decrease indicates negative speed, where the sailplane wents down.
