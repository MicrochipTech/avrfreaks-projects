## Summary

This standalone Windows executable allows you to encode any scalable font you have installed. It does a preliminary (and rough) encoding, then you can edit the encoding as you like.


It creates data of up to 32 by 32 bits for each character. You may scan the characters horizontally or vertically for a total of 8 different scan patterns. The output can be zero padded at the end of each row or column, or can be packed. Output can be in bytes or words (either endian), decimal or hexadecimal.


The project consists of an executable (does not need runtime support or installation of any kind) and a pdf file giving a simple introduction to the program.
