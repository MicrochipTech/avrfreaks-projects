# Tiny13 Assembler Template

## Summary

This template was written for a customer who wanted help with setting up the peripherals of the Tiny13. As written, the file will simply re-initialise all the peripherals in their power-on reset state, i.e. it effectively does nothing. It does, however, provide a template suitable for quickly editing peripheral configurations, so it is a good starting point for any Tiny13 based project. I will try to improve the timer descriptions at some point, although this is difficult if trying to avoid the descriptions becoming a pure transcription of the Atmel data sheet! A Tiny2313 version is also in the pipeline.
