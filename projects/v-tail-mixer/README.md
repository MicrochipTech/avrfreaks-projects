## Summary

The V-tail Mixer combines two R/C servo signals and provides two output channels, the sum and differential of the input chanels. The mixer gives you a prefect solution for rudder and elevator control for V-Tailed airplanes. But beside airplanes it's also can be used for any other vehicle which has two independent drive system on both side and RPM difference is used (or it can help) for turning the vehicle. For example a tank with catepillars, ship with two screws, airplane or hovercraft with to propellers.
