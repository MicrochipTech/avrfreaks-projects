## Summary

26-02-2005  

I've added source code and uploaded schematic rev. 1.1.

This is connection of my two projects: cf2avr and wav2avr.  

Avr microprocessor reads wave file from cf card, and then plays it on speaker. I've tested it with 22kHz and 44kHz waves. The sound quality isn't great (8bits only) but very better than in wav2avr project. In future I exchange dac08 to some 16 bits dac. Soon I will upload source code, because it's a little bit messy now so I must clean it. All is controlled by pc acros rs232 (any program to communicate ex. Doclight).
