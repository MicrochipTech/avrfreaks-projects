## Summary

Project:0043  

Purpose:Versatile Mains countdown timer  

Status :Working  

Level :Expert  

I/O :Full utilization 


Dear AVR freaks,  

 Using an ATtiny2313, the I-Grid is a fully utilized and programmed countdown task device. Just enter the time period that you want a mains (220V) load to be in”ON” state. Counting down was never been so easy before…


Good luck all,  

Timos


I hope on-line magazines to be someday as friendly as this great Web site for publishing my projects
