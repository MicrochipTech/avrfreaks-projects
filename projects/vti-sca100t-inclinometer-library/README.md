# VTI SCA100T inclinometer library

## Summary

VTI's SCA100T dual-axis inclinometer library. There is a software SPI support for a dual chip combination to achieve full real time 3-axis detection (you need two chips which are properly oriented, offset calibrated and maybe more). Nowadays there is true 3-axis 3D Mems sensors, so i suggest to use them instead.  

I have no use of these libraries anymore, so why not sharing them?


So, i you are newbie with AVR and you have some VTI's inclinometers, this library may help you. I have not tested the code for a while, but it should work ok. I'm unable to give more specific information, how the code and inclinometers work, but i don't think that's no problem to get things working...as usually more or less time and nerves are needed.


Last but not least: 256Kbit EEPROM-chip library (M95256, STMicroelectronics) also included.
