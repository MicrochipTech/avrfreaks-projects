## Summary

This programmer is different from the others because, in addition to using a standard quartz oscillator can use an DIP14 clock generator. To set the operating mode you must set the jumper SV2. To use quartz oscillator you must short pin 1 and 2 of SV2 jumpers, to use DIP14 clock must short pin 2 and 3.


This programmer is designed to be used with PonyProg and must use the serial port on PC and external 5V power supply.
