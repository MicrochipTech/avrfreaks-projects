## Summary

Have you ever wished your keychain knew where your car was?

The system will not allow me to upload my zip file.  

I get a blank page.


The Finder is a prototype of that device. It is a keychain-sized GPS device with two buttons, Save and Find. Pressing Save records your current location. Pressing Find visually leads you back to the saved location. Up to 9 locations can be saved.


The Finder uses the Great Circle navigation algorithm explained in this Circuit Cellar article "Navigating with GPS" by Jeff Stefan.


The Finder requires an ATMEGA88 or larger, a three-digit, common cathode LED display (Mouser BC56-11EWA or BC56-12GWA), an AARLOGIC GPS 3A or similar GPS module, and a 3.6 volt battery. A cell phone battery (3.7V) or three NiMH cells will work. If you use three Alkaline cells, use a series diode to reduce the voltage by 0.7 volts. Other parts required are four transistors, twelve resistors, a capacitor, and two buttons. The program is about 3500 bytes long.
