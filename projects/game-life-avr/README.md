# The Game of Life on an AVR

## Summary

The reason for making this project is that I was always fascinated by Conways Game of Life. It's a great demonstration of the fact that simple things with a very simple set of rules can do wonderful things: spawn more of them, modify themselves, do logical operations, even create Turing machines. I suspect much more can be done using them, but there are even more interesting methods of doing so. 


I made a simple implementation of Life on a PC, but so have a bazilion other people before me. My implementation is on a simpler device: An AVR with a 4x20 character display. The whole project is on my page.
