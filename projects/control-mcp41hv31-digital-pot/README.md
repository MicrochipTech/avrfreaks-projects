## Summary

Hi all,


few days ago I needed digital potentiometer for one application. A quick look has returned Microchip's MCP41HV31 Digital Pot. This pot is controlled via SPI, which is nice, because Bascom-AVR can handle SPI with ease.


In the program all 4 commands are described: Increment/Decrement (wiper) and Read/Write (wiper position).


Program itself is in details described in my blog.


Cheers
