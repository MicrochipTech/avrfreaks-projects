## Summary

The Xmega controls an Analog Devices AD9851 Direct Digital Synthesis (DDS) chip to create sine and square waves of frequencies 0 - 10 MHz (or so) with very high frequency resolution and stability. A matrix keypad is used to enter the desired frequency, and an LCD displays the current frequency.
