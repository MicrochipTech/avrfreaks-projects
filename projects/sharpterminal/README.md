## Summary

SharpTerminal is a terminal program much like Bray terminal but designed from scratch with responsiveness in mind. The result is a program that provides many of the features I as an embedded developer need but in a modern wrapping.  

Features are continuously added and bugs are removed when I find them or when others report them to me so make sure to check for updates every now and then.


Please give it a try at [http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1291922/...](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1291922/SharpTerminal.exe). Hope you like it. Send any comments, bug reports, feature requests etc. you have to sharpterminal at gmail dot com


Thanks to the creator of Bray terminal for many years of good service and for inspiration to SharpTerminal.
