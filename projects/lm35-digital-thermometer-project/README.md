## Summary

Another AVR and LM35 Digital Thermometer Project


I know, there have been so many digital thermometer projects out there. In fact, I already have made a couple of digital thermometer projects before and the one that I am writing about today is actually the third iteration. Even though this project is considered clichÃ©, that didnâ€™t stop me from creating another one. Well, if a thing is worth doing, then itâ€™s worth redoing and the fun of making things is what matters.
