This project implements a coloured LED light suitable for a child's toy or nightlight.
A 3-colour RGB led displays an ever-changing colour and intensity.   When a button is 
pressed the pattern of colour changing alters rate and direction.

Very small children enjoy the feedback of affecting the colour changes.

The LED is driven using an ATTiny13 microcontroller and software-generated 
pulse-width-modulation (PWM).
