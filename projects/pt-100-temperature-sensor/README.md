## Summary

This is the my first project on AVRFREAKS so please feel free to use it as you wish. If you find something that is incorrect please let me know.  

Firstly I would like to Thank Jim Wagner (ka7ehk) as he gave me a lot of very helpful information on the PT100.


This is just a small part of a major project that I am working on, but I thought others might find this useful.


This is simply a temperature measuring set-up using a RTD more specifically the PT100.  

For more information of the PT100 visit ([http://www.maxim-ic.com/appnotes...](http://www.maxim-ic.com/appnotes.cfm/an_pk/3450)) .


Features:  

Temperature reading from 1-100 Â°C  

Output via Serial port 


The project simply displays the current temperature ever 2 seconds.


Feel free to use/modify this project.  

You can send me a PM if think I should change anything.


enjoy,


Stephen Walsh
