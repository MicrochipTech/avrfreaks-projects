## Summary

DISCLAIMER - These are not exactly where I want them. I am posting these as a completion to a request from someone. I was trying to get various hardware components on the chip working and have modded most of the examples to fit and run on the stk600. To see how to hookup your board check STK600.h. Also not all things in the examples work, such as LEDs and Joystick functionality. I wanted the main stuff to work and didn't worry about fluff.


Anyway, this code is provided AS IS but I will answer all the questions I can. I don't like the way I made the earlier ones to work, but they do. The latter ones are more portable and fit with the real examples better.


Have fun.
