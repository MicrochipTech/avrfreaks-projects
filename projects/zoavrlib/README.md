## Summary

ZoAvrLib is a C library for AVR Mega Processors and the avr-gcc compiler. Functionality provided by the avr-libc is utilized wherever possible and appropriate. Development of this library has started on the popular Mega48/88/168/328 AVR processors. The aim is to gradually support all AVR Mega processors.


The goal of this library is to provide easy to use functions, which are fast, reliable and work out-of-the-box. We sincerely hope that the functionality provided will give programmers and microcontroller enthusiasts the opportunity to focus on their task-at-hand rather than processor specifics.


The zoAvrLib library is coded with a naming scheme that takes advantage of auto complete features included in IDEs like Eclipse and the free Ms Visual C++ 2008 Express. So the use of such an IDE for developing code, together with the zoAvrLib makes it even faster and easier to develop code.


This library is hosted at Google Code pages at: <http://code.google.com/p/zoavrlib/>


Special thanks to the avr-lib project guys and the gnu community for providing this great and free compiler. Also thumbs up to Pascal Stang and his Procyon AvrLib project which inspired this library.


The zoAvrLib is a project under constant development.
