## Summary

If you need to calculate a node voltage for a simple poor man's D to A converter, this may help. It will show you all the states for 2 inputs, and the current state for up to 7 inputs. It also has a tab for a simple low pass filter.


Added an active, 2-pole, low pass filter. This is a Sallen-Key filter and is a great anti-alias filter as it has extremely low output impedance.


Added the units for the simple low-pass filter to reduce ambiguity. Fixed the drawing, thanks to Ross McKenzie at ValuSoft for identifying the wrong placement of components.
