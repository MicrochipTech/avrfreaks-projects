## Summary

The digital light dimmer is designed to control the  

light intensity and on/off times for loads up to 20A at 220V and  

can be used as firing circuit for high current SCRs for larger  

loads. Control the light intensity from zero to full power with  

100 levels and the on/off time can by adjusted digitally using  

the user interface. This design demonstrates the idea of  

the digital phase control with the SCRs. This idea used in many  

industrial applications as:


1- Light Dimming.  

2- DC Motors speed control.  

3- AC Motors Soft Starter.  

4- Battery Chargers.
