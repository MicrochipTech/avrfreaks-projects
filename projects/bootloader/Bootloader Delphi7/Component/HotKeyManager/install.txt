How to install the component
----------------------------

*** YOU NEED TO INSTALL THE COMPONENT BEFORE OPENING THE DEMOS IN DELPHI. ***


If you're running Delphi 5 or later:

1. Open HotKeyManager_D5.dpk (Delphi 5) or HotKeyManager_D6plus.dpk (Delphi 6
   or later) either by doubleclicking the file or by selecting "Open Project"
   inside Delphi. (HotKeyManager_D5.dpk may work for older Delphi versions
   as well, but I don't know for sure. Please tell me if I'm right.)

2. Click Compile, then Install.

3. You may need to add the folder containing the component to your library path 
   (select Tools -> Environment Options from the menu).

4. That's it. The component should be visible in the component palette
   in the tab called "System".



If you're running Delphi versions older than ver. 5:

1. Try the steps above with the HotKeyManager_D5.dpk file (it may work in
   older versions of Delphi, but I don't know for sure. Please tell me).
   If this doesn't work then do the following:

2. Select "Install Component" from the "Component" menu item (may vary
   depending on your Delphi version).

3. A dialog displays where you must select the component to install and
   the package to install into. I recommend creating a new package, if you
   haven't already done so, rather than installing into the default package.

4. Browse for the HotKeyManager.pas file and select OK.

5. You may need to add the folder containing the component to your library path 
   (select Tools -> Environment Options from the menu).

6. That's it. The component should be visible in the component palette
   in the tab called "System".
