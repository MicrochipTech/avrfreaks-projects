# CX80 - homebrew 8bit computer

## Summary

The CX80 is a computer based on avr microcontrollers and Z80 CPU that you can build at house with a really low price. Of course I asked for some more in-depth knowledge of electronics such as knowing how to make a single sided pcb and know how program the atmel microcontroller. If you are not able to make it alone, do not worry, I can build it for you! I do not provide: a regulated 4.5 â€“ 5.0 Volt DC mains adapter with a 1.3mm jack (centre positive) capable of supplying about 800 mA (or more), a sd card (FAT16/32 formatted) and an RCA cable to connect the CX80 at the television, a piezo speaker and a switch for the reset pins.
