## Summary

After being emailed for the millionth time, I am uploading my ADF7020-1 code which allows a user to program a pair of DF7020-1 transceivers as a FSK transmitter/receiver or a OOK transmitter/receiver combination. Developed in 2008 by myself as a club project. Tested with Atmega164p, Atmega324p, and Atmega644p.


Until I learn how to upload a 6MB file, get it here
