Use:
GetReport	-  read testing data only
SetReport	-  send data to usart
WriteData	-  if fill buffer from USART then send to PC or timeout and any data..

Used internal RC oscilator 8Mhz
Tested in ARDUINO LEONARDO dev board.
Powered from USB.
UART out used for debug data..
use 9600bps speed for USART
define timeout 32ms, if no data are received from usart and buffer
got some data then send it to PC.

This fimrware don't use Report ID
firmware size is 1562bytes , ram usage is 68bytes.
