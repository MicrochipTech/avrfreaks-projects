# DC - Motor Driver

## Summary

This is a good start for newbies who crave for driving something.... There are ICs for dc motors, but a optocoupler and 4 transistors will do as well. This driver can drive any motor size. Adjust the powersupply accordingly. Select the power transistors according to the current rating of the motor. Make sure that only one direction is turned on (negative active!) to avoid smoke... Test the driver manually by substituting both fuses in the secondary power line with two light bulbs and turn on one optocoupler manually. The driver is pulsed to stabilise speeed but has no speed control. Since a opto coupler is used remote control is possible via a telephone wire (100m).  

Good Luck.
