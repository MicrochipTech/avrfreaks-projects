THANK YOU!!!

Okay so this code was downloaded from:
http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1011/P31/lib/
On April 16, 2011

I also found almost the same code on avrfreaks, http://tom-itx.dyndns.org:81/~webpage/how_to/atmega168/mega168_rs232_index.php, and a few other pages.

So, who was / is the author... ?  Don't know, it's example code published all over the net.

To use this you need to init the console speed.

Have a look here for how to do this:

Oh, use software flow control
