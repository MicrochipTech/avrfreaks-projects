**2008/05/11**: my server at home has problems with the dsl provider:  

 freenet.de is unable to solve my dns problems, so i have to reset the dsl-router sometime up to 10 times a day ! if you cannot connect please try 1-2 minutes later again. now i cancelled the dsl contract with freenet.de (never again freenet !) and i hope to get a better provider...  

**2008/05/28**: sorry: i had internal problems yesterday (my ethernet-switch had no power), its fixed now and online again. SORRY !  

**2008/06/04**: now it have a more serious problem: my dsl at home is not working any more -> avrwizonline is now avrwizoffline !!! i'll switch to a new dsl provider (with 16 instead of 6 mbit) in about 2 weeks, it might be that i'm offline for the complete time (again: i hate freenet !)  

**2008/06/05**: should be online again, lets see how long :-(  

dont forget: this online wizard is hosted on a nslu2 on an usb-stick -> its not the fastest :-)
