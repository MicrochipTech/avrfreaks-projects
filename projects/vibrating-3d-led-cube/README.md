## Summary

The 5x5 LED matrix vibrates up and down at 10 Hz. The display then shows three-dimensional images in a 5x5x5 matrix. An ATMEGA16 is used to control the LED's and sense when the photo-switch is interrupted. Visual Basic 2008 is used to create the images on the desktop, one layer at a time.
