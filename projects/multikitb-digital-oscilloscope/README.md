## Summary

MultiKitB is a multi purpose development kit using AVR microcontrollers. It is targeted for anyone who wants to start learning AVR micros. The big thing about the MultiKitB is that it is also a fully featured Mixed Signal Oscilloscope and Spectrum Analyzer. The MultiKitB has a bootloader which allows firmware updates and programming your own applications using the serial port (an external AVR programmer is not needed).


**Oscilloscope Specifications:**  

 1 Analog Channel  

 Input Impedance: 1MÎ©  

 Maximum Input Voltage: +/- 25V (+/- 250V if using a 10:1 probe)  

 A/D Converter Resolution: 8 bits  

 Maximum Sampling Rate: 3.2MS/s  

 Trigger jitter = 312nS (1 pixel at highest sampling rate)  

 3 Digital Inputs: 5V level 


**Oscilloscope Features:**  

 Time Base (S/division): 5u, 10u, 20u, 50u, 100u, 200u, 500u, 1m, 2m, 5m, 10m, 20m, 50m, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2  

One division consists of 16 pixels (example: 5uS / division = 5uS / 16 pixels ==> 312.5nS / pixel) 


 Gain (Volts / division): 20m, 50m, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5  

 Horizontal Cursors  

 Vertical Cursors  

 Automatic Average and Peak to Peak measurements  

 FFT and automatic search of fundamental frequency  

 Export to BMP through RS-232 using HyperTerminal 


**The MultiKitB demonstrates:**  

 LCD Displays, SED1335 driver  

 Analog to Digital Converters  

 Rotary Encoders  

 RS-232 Interface  

 XModem File Transfer  

 I/O Multiplexing  

 Negative Voltage Generation  

 Fast Fourier Transforms  

 Pseudo Random Numbers  

 Fractional and Fixed Point Numbers  

 Linked Lists and Memory Management


These topics are demonstrated with 6 applications:  

DEMO: A physics simulation of particles  

SKTCH: The popular painting game  

3D: Demo using rotary encoders to change viewing angle of a sphere  

PIANO: Simple Mini Piano  

FRCTL: Fractals to demo simple math and random numbers  

RS232: RS-232 Terminal
