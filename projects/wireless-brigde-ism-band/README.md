## Summary

The Wireless Bridge ISM-Band is as the name says, intended to act as a wireless bridge for serial communication,  

it is designed to be used for multiple purposes (USB, RS232 ans RS485).  

The project is build around a RFM12B transceiver, which exists in 315MHz, 433MHz, 868Mhz and 915MHz, i have choosen  

to use the 868MHz, which i think is to be preferred over 433Mhz, since 868MHz isent that crowded. 


Futher infomations can be found on the url (Code and Gerber will be availible shortly).
