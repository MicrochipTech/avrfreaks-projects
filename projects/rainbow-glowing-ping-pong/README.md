## Summary

The idea was to build up a tiny board that fits into ping-pong and glow in rainbow colors using RGB LED driven by attiny13 microcontroller. Device is powered from CR2032 battery and uses software switch with auto power-off.  

Since battery voltage drops over time and LED requires higher voltage than provided, hardware is transforming voltage to higher and provides stabilization.
