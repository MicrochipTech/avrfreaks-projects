## Summary

User-defined C# apps on a Master-PC control embedded microcontroller applications over a network. Networking is based on a defined MCNF Command-Response-Protocol. A small and easy-to-implement networking kernel on each microprocessor handles this protocol.  

Many standard functions are built-in, e.g.  

 - regular connectivity tests  

 - read and write of embedded variables  

 - save to EEPROM and load from EEPROM of embedded variables  

 - gateway functions  

Two key features are unique in MCNF:  

 - The microcontroller network may consist of a heterogeneous mix of  

 UART, IÂ²C, SPI, Ethernet and other standards.  

 - The C# applications are not affected by changes in the network  

 configuration; the user may for example run an application locally  

 in his lab or remotely via Ethernet gateway without changing a  

 single line of the C# code.  

MCNF includes an integrated development environment with project database, system and network configurator, data editor, scripting support and tools for testing and message tracing.  

MCNF comes with â€œGetting Startedâ€, documentation and tutorials based on Arduino hardware (Atmel AVR ATmega328P, ATmega32u4 and others).
