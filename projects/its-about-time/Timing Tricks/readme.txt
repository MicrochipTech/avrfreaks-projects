The example code files follow the order of the article, with the exception of example 3 which was not discussed.

The code is written in a simple style to make it more readable for all levels of programming skills.  There are better ways to design and code the examples in almost all cases, but cleverness has been superseded by clarity (hopefully).

All code samples are written for an AVR ATmega16 MCU, an 8 bit RISC processor, using the ImageCraft AVR C compiler.  The full compiler is available for a free 45 day non-commercial trial period, after which is becomes size limited but otherwise fully functional.  Different MCUs will have different characteristics, and different compilers will likely use slightly different syntax on certain nonstandard C features.

A free programming IDE (AVR Studio) is available for download from the Atmel web site.  Many other resources, including datasheets, application notes, and other documentation are also available on the site.

One of the best sources of AVR information is the very active user community at http://www.avrfreaks.net.  In addition to participant created threads there are project and tutorial sections which contain many complete projects (hardware and software) and tutorials on a variety of topics.  Have a look at the tutorial on AVR programming methods for an overview of how to get your program loaded into the MCU.  Please read the posting guidelines in each forum prior to posting there.
