## Summary

This is my first AVR project. It is a Midi Foot Controller for the Line 6 POD XT, but could be easily modified to work with any Effects unit with a MIDI interface. It has the following features.  

* MIDI Channel Selection  

* Channel Up/Down  

* Stomp On/Off  

* Modulation On/Off  

* Delay On/Off  

* Analogue Pedal Input to control Wah/Volume/Drive/Channel Volume with bargraph display  

* Two way communication with POD XT. Retrieves Channel Name, Status of Stomp, Modulation and Delay when the channel is changed at the Foot Controller or the POD
