## Summary

We have often talked about how many batteries we use for our self and our kids,  

some are Alkaline and some are NIMH rechargeable.  

But in most cases we wanted to measure what we got for our bucks,  

so we can choose the best and cheapest solution in all cases.  

To be able to do this as smart and as cheap as possible, we decided to construct this simple discharger,  

it consist of parts for small money and can easily be copied, we even left all the sw files online.
