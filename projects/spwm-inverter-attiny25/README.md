## Summary

This is a project/tutorial for a Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation (SPWM) Power Inverter.


Using ATtiny25 to drive the power stages - with automatic fallback to


Modified Square Wave (MSW) when needed.   

Uses push-pull and a center-tapped power transformer.


Working since 2003 as MSW and now updated for SPWM.


Sorry, no code for the lazy ones, but all guidelines to build it are inside the document


(there is no selection for no code...)


Please, first read and then ask - if you are interested on the project.
