## Summary

The complex provides the advanced opportunities and is used as the tool of fast designing.  

Function of a complex consists in granting of the full environment of designing.  

Purpose of a complex consists in reduction of realization time of production. 


Complex LJ.RTOS includes OS «LG.RTOS» and the convenient visual environment of designing.  

Use of the visual environment of designing and ready mechanisms RTOS reduces time of designing since several months till several o'clock.


How he works?  

Creation of the software and hardware includes the following steps:  

 - Review of ready hardware decisions;  

 - Creation of the project;  

 - Choice of the compiler;  

 - Choice of the RTOS;  

 - Choice of the processor;  

 - Disposition on the processor of required periphery:  

 LCD, Keyboard, Memory, Files, Nets, Protocols, etc;  

 - Adaptation of periphery and the equipment;  

 - Addition into existing system mechanisms of the user code;  

 - Compilation of the program;  

 - Write of the code into microcontroller.


The complex contains ready hardware decisions and descriptions of platforms. 


OS LG.RTOS - a mobile kernel created in language ANSI C.  

OS provides porting for 8-bit microcontrollers ATMEL and of compilers: WinAVR, ImageCRAFT, IAR and Code Vision AVR.
