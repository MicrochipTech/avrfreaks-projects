## Summary

The MIDI Exiter is a LFO controlled MIDI continuous controller based on a AT90S4433 with several parameters to make it do more than the standard sinus wave form. It can do sinus, square and triangle wave and deform the wave shape.  

Note this is an interim project, and the next version will do much more of the same. 


So this isn't a very standard MIDI project, but is of interest for musicians using MIDI as sound control instead of score notation.
