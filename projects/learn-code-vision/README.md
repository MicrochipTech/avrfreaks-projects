## Summary

 For most of the engineering students they don't know how to start their first program and what are the prerequsits for programming in AVR ICs. As per my knowledge i found AVR is a friendly and easy to learn IC, but also powerful.


 But before to run we must walk henve iam produsing some of the sample programs through which everybody will get benifited. Especialy the new ones who doesn't know how and where to start.


 Download all the files and go through it. Don't get panic if you don't know how to execuit it and where to get the header files and supporting file. First try to understand the simple c used in embedded System then you can understand the difficult ones.
