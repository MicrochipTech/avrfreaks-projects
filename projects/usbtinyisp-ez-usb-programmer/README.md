## Summary

A simple open-source USB AVR programmer and SPI interface. It is [low cost ($16 in parts)](http://www.ladyada.net/make/usbtinyisp/parts.html), [easy to make](http://www.ladyada.net/make/usbtinyisp/solder.html), works great with [avrdude](http://www.ladyada.net/make/usbtinyisp/avrdude.html), is [AVRStudio-compatible](http://www.ladyada.net/make/usbtinyisp/stk500compat.html) and tested under Windows and MacOS X. Perfect for students and beginners, or as a backup programmer. Comes with both 6 and 10 pin cables and a jumper for powering the target board from the USB hubâ€™s 5V power.


The project is based off of the [USBtiny bitbang code & design](http://www.xs4all.nl/%7Edicks/avr/usbtiny/) and includes a PCB layout & schem, pre-compiled software binaries and drivers, and a bridge software to make it work with avrstudio in stk500-compatible mode.


You can build this design using the [schematic and firmware](http://www.ladyada.net/make/usbtinyisp/download.html), or buy a full kit from the [Adafruit webshop](http://www.adafruit.com/).
