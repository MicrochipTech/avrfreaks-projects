## Summary

Teachers Timer is an innovative and discrete timing device for assisting teachers and lecturers. Using cell phone style vibrations and a simple one-button interface the user can be alerted to the passage of time without staring at the clock. For  

lectures and presentations the device can also include a laser pointer that will gently fade in and out to alert the user.
