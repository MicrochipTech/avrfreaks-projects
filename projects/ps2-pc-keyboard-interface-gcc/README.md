## Summary

A PS2 PC-AT keyboard interface, based on Atmel App Note AVR-313, converted to GCC. Plug the keyboard into the AVR, sends the characters out the UART to your PC screen as characters or ASCII codes. My first step towards a PS2 bar code scanner. Has a nice interrupt based UART transmit routine. [don@botgoodies.com](mailto:don@botgoodies.com).
