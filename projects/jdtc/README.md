## Summary

This project will control the heater and valves connected to each heating device.  

this way you can set up to 8 rooms different temperatures.  

the temperatures are measured with the 1 wire ds1820  

everything is controlled with a java program  

for the moment the java program and documentation is in dutch language  

I plan to change that into english in the future.  

The controller soft is in english.  

All temperatures are logged on an sd card, and shown in statistics on the java program.  

the controller works with a atmega32  

with I2C clock and I/O  

the communication is with rs232 at 38400 baud  

All settings and loggings are stored in MS SQL 2005 express server  

I will post the SQL script, the hex file, the schema, the java program.


I hope to receive feedback from those using or trying to use this project


regards zuran
