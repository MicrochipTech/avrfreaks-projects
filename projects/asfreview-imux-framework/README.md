# [ASFReview] IMUX framework.

## Summary

I had developed a HW platform called IMUX that is basicly an inertial measurement unit with ATXmega128A1, SRAM, Flash SPI, ZigBee, barometer/altimeter and a three axis magnetometer that fits into the CANSat specification (when removing the ZigBee module). The main SW function here is an attempt to write a little framework on top of ASF to have something basic done as starting point for other applications.
