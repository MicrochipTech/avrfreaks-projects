## Summary

I had been through tough time getting my programs into the controller. I used to use the funcard AVR programmer. However, I somehow managed to screwup my parallel port (I dont know what is burnt inside). and another problem was that i use a laptop. So fianally decided to go for a USB based programmer. Very less googling, found a website <http://www.obdev.at/> (Objective Development). who give a USB software only firmware. Also, find the link to USBAsp which is also based on the obdev's firmware, and also supported by latest avrdude program downloader available with WinAVR. I used to make PCB's, and finally thought may be I try doing a PCB for this.! So here is the WinAVR CODE + the PCB design in CadSOFT Eagle.
