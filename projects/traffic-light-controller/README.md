## Summary

In order to save board size I chose the Atmel ATTiny15L microcontroller for the most bang for the buck in an 8 pin package. The basic components started out as the microcontroller, a voltage regulator (7805) to feed it and a push button to swap between light sequences. The outputs from the microcontroller go to three optoisolators (MOC3010) which in turn drive three triacs (BTA10) to feed power to the three lamps connected via a small screw terminal block.
