Timer/Counter1 16-bit  
    The 16-bit Timer/Counter unit allows accurate program execution timing (event management), wave generation, and signal timing measurement. The main features are:
    
               • True 16-bit Design (i.e., Allows 16-bit PWM)
               • Two Independent Output Compare Units
               • Double Buffered Output Compare Registers
               • One Input Capture Unit
               • Input Capture Noise Canceler
               • Clear Timer on Compare Match (Auto Reload)
               • Glitch-free, Phase Correct Pulse Width Modulator (PWM)
               • Variable PWM Period
               • Frequency Generator
               • External Event Counter
               • Four Independent Interrupt Sources (TOV1, OCF1A, OCF1B, and ICF1)
