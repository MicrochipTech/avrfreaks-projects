# Mega32 SPI ADC/DAC

## Summary

While the Mega32 has an ADC and while the PWM channels can be used as a low bandwidth DAC, sometimes it is useful to connect external devices for ADC/DAC functions. Such devices may be faster, support more bits, or have lower noise. These simple examples show how to set up the SPI using the Codevision SPI library, and how to bypass the library for more speed. An AD7303 DAC can give two-channel update rates of over 100KHz when bypassing the library.
