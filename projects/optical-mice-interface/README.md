## Summary

This is an entry for the 2006 Atmel/Circuit Cellar contest (won Distinctive Excellence mention). It supports up to 3 standard or optical wheel mice on 6 I/O pins, and is controlled via an RS232 serial line. A command language is implemented.


When disemboweled, the 3 optical wheel mice become 9 switches, 3 X-Y, and 3 Z axis input sensors. The purpose is to show a possible method of inexpensive (under $10 per mouse) multiplexed cheesy robotics input devices.


The project is implemented using an STK500 with no additional hardware other than an additional power supply.
