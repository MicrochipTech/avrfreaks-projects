## Summary

This plug-in is an extension for AVR Studio 4 , witch allow users to read/write registers , get information ,... from AVR Studio using TCP/IP , so you can code your own TFT/LCD , BUTTONs, LEDs as a server application to get data from the target in AVR Studio , then use it to simulate the behaviour of your device versus registers values...


(devices are not subject of that plug-in; for the current build , it just allow you to communicate and get/set data from/to AVR Studio 4. Stay tuned for stable releases/versions !)
