## Summary

The RAR file includes Assembler source file, C compliler source file, HEX file and simulationable file that you can use it for simulation the project with Proteus Software(i used v6.7SP2)  

a 1.8 Degree stepper motor can be drived with a microcontroller(ATmega 8 in this project) and a buffer like ULN2003 for protect the microcontroller against high current.  

an LCD shows the position of the shaft of motor each moment.
