## Summary

Two separate programs for 'burning' external EEPROMs using an ALE-bus AVR (Mega162) for the Parallel programmer and a Mega8 for the serial programmer (using TWI). Fully documented modular assembler source code with subroutines that can be cut-and-pasted into other programs needing these functions. GIF file schematics and test-programs included.
