## Summary

[NEW] Tutorial Added!


In order to quantify motion by sampling light intensity, we must be able to discern between noise and impulses created by movement. This is done by finding the difference between the current value and the average of a string of previous values. The result of this computation is a 16 bit value directly proportional to any motion between the photoresistor and any stable light sources.
