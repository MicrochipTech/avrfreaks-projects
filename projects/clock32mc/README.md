## Summary

To check that the microcontroller runs at 32 Mhz, we use a for loop which creates a delay. Afterwards the program toggles the output pin D0. Once you have measured the signal period, you can disable all the functions between the forward slash signs, compile it again and download it into the microcontroller. The output signal period will be much longer than before.
