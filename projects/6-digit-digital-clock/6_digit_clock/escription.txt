6-digit digital clock


This is my first hobby project ever any constructive critique would be appreciated. I've started this about 4 years ago and finally got finished.

Features:

- clock
- alarm clock mode using internal beeper
- alarm clock mode activating relay to connect or disconnect wires of external circuit
- countdown timer mode enabling internal beeper when reaching zero
- countdown timer mode enabling internal relay to connect or disconnect wires of external circuit when reaching zero

- all values and modes can be set using menu on Led display controlled by four buttons

Note about relay and speaker:

Please read documentation of your relay regarding value of resistor R_RELAY switching the coil
I've used PC-speaker as internal buzzer but any piezo-speaker would work too.

Note about power supply:

you can use 5V power supply to power whole circuit. I've decided to use external 5V power supply because of overheating while using voltage regulator.


Usage:

button PinB0	enter setup/cancel without changes
button PinB1    increases selected display/select
button PinB2	select next display/move in menu
button PinB4	set values to counter of seconds and exit menu
internal alarm now uses speaker to generate sound
external/internal alarm clock may be disabled (until next cycle)
OFF function appears in menu only if countdown/alarm is set.
When selected, alarm/coutdown is disabled immediately
