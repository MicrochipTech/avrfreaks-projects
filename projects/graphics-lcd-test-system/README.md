## Summary

The graphics LCD test system project served to evaluate 128 x 64 pixel graphics LCDs and develop a basic user interface for subsequent use in a turbocharger control product. Six different graphics LCDs were evaluated and as part of this project firmware was developed for an Atmel ATMega644P microcontroller along with hardware interfaces. Not much information or code examples are available for interfacing graphics LCDs to Atmel AVR microcontrollers, so we hope that publishing the project details will prove helpful to others.
