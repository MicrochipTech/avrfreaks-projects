** Flashing LED circle  **
** By Rolf R Bakke 2007 **


12 LED's flashing in different random-driven patterns, some includes variable intensity (12 channel PWM).
Mount the LED's in a wall clock, or anywhere else! :)

There is files for AT90S1200 and ATtiny2313.
Set the fuses to run them on the internal oscillator at 1MHz
