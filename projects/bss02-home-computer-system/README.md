## Summary

Many times faster than the Commodore, TRS-80, and other old computers that inspired it, this system consists of little more than an AVR, a crystal and three resistors. Optionally, add Dataflash for program storage or an external SRAM to expand the amount of available RAM. Outputs NTSC video (PAL would be a simple modification) and powers up to a BASIC interpreter. Peek and Poke commands allow access to AVR's peripherals. I wrote this so long ago, I don't even remember all the other features that are included.
