<P>The BSS 02 is a computer system inspired by early home computers, such as the Commodore PET, TRS-80, and Apple II. Because the AVR is capable of running much faster than the 6502 and Z80 processors used in the earlier computers, a complete system can consist of a single AVR with a few simple components. Despite generating the video signal through software, it still runs much, much faster than the computers that inspired it. The AVR Butterfly version uses a serial port instead of generating video, so it even more efficient.</P>

<P>The system consists on nothing more than an STK-500, three resistors, and a crystal. Note: The Mega8515 does not have enough on-board RAM to support the 32x16 video resolution. For video, you will need an AVR with 1k or more of RAM (or add an external SRAM to the Mega8515).</P>

Despite it's simplicity, it drastically outperforms the computers that inspired it. I ran some simple benchmarks to test the performance. The results are summarized in the table below. This is for the video version. The serial version runs nearly twice as fast.<p>

<P>Though I was tempted to use a cassette interface for loading and saving programs, I decided to use the Dataflash chip already installed on the STK-500 and AVR Butterfly. This is much faster than cassette or floppy disk drives.</P>

<P>I wrote this program (along with Davros and a few others) in the fall of 2005 while I was living in the German city of Frankfurt/Oder. I named it the BSS 02 because it seemed a worthy successor to the BSS 01, a pong TV game developed in Frankfurt/Oder in the early 80’s while the city was still part of the German Democratic Republic. More information on the BSS 01 can be found at the Berlin Computer Game museum’s web site: </FONT><A HREF="http://www.computerspielemuseum.de/katalog.28.html"><FONT SIZE=2>http://www.computerspielemuseum.de/katalog.28.html</FONT></A></P>

<P>The code started as a port of Li-Chen Wang’s TinyBasic, published in a 1976 issue of Doctor Dobb’s Journal. Most of the original comments are still in the source. I modified this original code quite heavily, adding code to tokenize the source (allowing for more efficient use of the limited on-board RAM and improving performance), FOR/NEXT, READ/DATA, a simple file system, new math functions, limited string support, and some simple video and sound functions. I planned to add PC keyboard support, floating point math, and improve the string support but never finished.</P>

<P>When the BSS 02 starts, it will greet the user with the prompt:</P>

<P>AVR TinyBasic v1.2
<br>OK
<br>&gt;_

<P>Type in commands via a computer connected to the serial port. For example, the classic hello world program:</P>

<P>10 ?&quot;Hello world!&quot;
<br>20 goto 10
<br>run

<P>Hit Ctrl-C to stop the program.</P>

<P>Letters A-Z can be used as variables. All arithmetic is integer.</P>
<P>Hex values can be used by preceeding them with &amp;, e.g. A = &amp;800</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>Summary of commands</P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P>All commands have shortcuts. For example, RET. is equivalant to RETURN.</P>
<P>TinyBasic is not case sensitive. PRINT is interpreted the same as print or pRiNt.</P>
<P>Unlike Microsoft BASIC, GOTO, GOSUB, and other commands take expressions as arguments rather than line numbers. This allows some flexibility in programming, such as creating conditional variable assignment: A=(X&lt;5)*5 + (X&gt;=5)*10. This will assign A to 5 if X is less than 5. If X &gt;= 5, A will be assigned to 10.</P>

<B><P>PRINT</B> (or <B>?</B>)</P>
<P>Display a message. Can display quoted text, variables, or a combination of the two.</P>

<B><P>IF</B> expression <B>THEN</B> command</P>
<P>The command can either be a line number (the GOTO will be assumed) or another BASIC command.</P>

<B><P>FOR</B> var <B>= </B>expr1 <B>TO</B> expr2 <B>STEP</B> expr3</P>
<P>Start a loop using the variable var, starting with the value of expr1 and ending with the value of expr2. The STEP value is optional. Default step value is 1.</P>

<B><P>NEXT</B> var</P>
<P>Mark the end of a FOR loop. The var is optional. If ommitted, it will loop back to the last FOR loop encountered.</P>

<B><P>GOTO</B> expr</P>
<P>Jump to the line given by the expression</P>

<B><P>READ</B> variable</P>
<P>Grab the next byte from the list of bytes given in the DATA expression</P>

<P>List of N bytes of data for the READ command</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>Error Messages</P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P>Errors are very limited in TinyBasic. There are only three errors: WHAT?, HOW?, and SORRY.</P>
<P>WHAT? usually denotes a syntax error.</P>
<P>HOW? indicates that a necessary argument is missing or invalid.</P>
<P>SORRY means the system has run out of free RAM.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>Modification &amp; Porting</P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P>Unfortunately, though the code is documented, there is currently no master document to explain how everything works in detail. It will take some time to understand all the code as it stands.</P>

<P>Porting to another AVR should not be difficult, however. The serial-only version of the program uses less than 4k. The video version uses less than 8k. Change the BAUD and OSC defines to match your desired serial bit rate and external clock frequency. Comment or uncomment the __VIDEO__ define depending on whether or not you want video support. Mega8515 and the Mega169 are the only two processors currently supported, but most changes will likely only require a small change to the console I/O functions (CONST, CONIN, and CONOUT). Some processors may also require the interrupt table or timer interrupt to be changed slightly.</P>

<P>The video version of the program will not fit inside a Mega8515 because of the limited RAM. If the Mega8515 is used with an external RAM chip, however, it will work quite well.</P>

<P>The file system is the same as what is used on Davros. The documentation for Davros is included.</P>
<p>
Though this version is written for an NTSC video signal, it was originally written for PAL. Switching between the two should be relatively simple.
