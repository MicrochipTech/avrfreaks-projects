During the last 5 weeks of the semester in ECE 4760, Microcontroller Design, students have to combine sensors, actuators, microcontrollers, and mathematical techniques to build something. All projects show a great deal of originality and work. There are over 380 projects on the page. This year the coding was done using WINAVR and AVRstudio.
