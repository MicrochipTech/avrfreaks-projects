## Summary

The purpose of the library is to show C++ is really useful for microcontroller applications. In AVR++ I tried to do in C++ some things that cannot be done in C. The library is not object-oriented, it uses C++ templates to generate highly optimized I/O code.


The library is primarily intended for use in developing highly-configurable reusable code that does not need to know how the extern devices are attached (may be even through "port-extenders" such as 74HC595).
