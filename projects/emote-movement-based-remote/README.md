# eMote - movement based remote

## Summary

In this project I have extended a B&O remote control so it will also respond to movement. You can easily change it to fit your remote controller.


In the design process I tried to make the remote resemble some kind of pet - ie. have emotions.  

As an example you put it on its back to make it quiet (mute).


The circuit consists of an Atmel ATtiny26L and 2 analog accelerometers plus some CMOS switches and code is pretty simple.


This project is from a research project in 2003 - long before the Wii :-)
