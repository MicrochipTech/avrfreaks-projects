## Summary

This is the 90S2313 firmware for a MIDI foot controller, but it can run on any AVR with 13 I/O pins. It is based on the RFX MP128P MIDIbuddy. There are 12 foot switches to access any one of 128 MIDI programs. The selected program is displayed on two 7-segment LEDs with a 100's digit. A set of six DIP switches allow setting the MIDI channel and some other minor parameters.  

 Includes full source in AVR assembler and a GIF schematic.
