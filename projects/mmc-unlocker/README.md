# MMC Unlocker

Uploaded by mjag17 on 2008-03-12 06:28:00 (rating 0 out of 5)

## Summary

This code lets you erase a previously locked (and thus in-accessible) Multi-Media Card, making it useful again.


Sorry there isn't much documentation, but the comments should be helpful. Used the serial port for all comms, can be made standalone though.


I wrote it to run on the STK500 (but can be used w/any AVR with enough pins), just plugged the card to the pin headers for PortC, and put some cards to make it thicker/hold it in place between the pins.


Update: 20080312  

Added some (blurry) pictures and reduced COM port speed
