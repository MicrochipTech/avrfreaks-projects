## Summary

My first attempt at a non-theoretical state machine in C, I tried to replicate the old "simon" games (with the four flashing LEDs and buttons). Works great on the STK500.


Demonstrates timer use to generate a random number seed, arrays, state machine programming, bit manipulation, sound generation, etc. Simple but those new to C may get somthing out of it.


Instructions on setup and how to play included in the C file.
