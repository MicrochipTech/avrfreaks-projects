 0. Preface

NMEA  Interface Standards are intended to serve the public
interest by facilitating interconnection and interchangeability
of eqipment, minimizing misunderstanding and confusion between
manufacturers, and assisting purchasers in selecting compatiblr
equipment.

Standards are adopted by NMEA without regard to whether or not
their adoption may involve patents on articles, materials or
processes. By such action, NMEA does not assume any liability to
any patent owner, nor does it assume any obligation whatever to
parties adopting these Standards.

This Standard defines electrical signal requirements, data trans-
mission protocol and timing, and specific sentence formats for a
4800 baud serial data bus. Each bus may have only a single TALK-
ER but may have multiple LISTENERS.

Because of differences in baud rate and other transmission param-
eters, NMEA 0183 data is not directly compatible with NMEA 0180
or NMEA 0182 Standards.

Equipment that is specified by IMO to meet the SOLAS regulations
is governed by the requirements of IEC doc.              TC80/WG6.
The IEC Standard is aligned closely with the NMEA 0183 Standard.
Where possible, differences between the two documents, and sec-
tions that pertain specifically to IEC requirements, are indi-
cated herein by the symbol "*" in the margin.

Information on the availability of these standards will be found
on the following page.

 1. Introduction

1.1 Scope

This standard is developed to permit ready and satisfactory data
communication between electronic marine instruments, navigation
equipment and communications equipment when interconnected via an
appropriate system.


1.2 Intended Application and Limitations on Use

This standard is intended to support one-way serial data trans-
mission from a single TALKER to one or more LISTENERs. This is
data in printable ASCII form and may include information such as
position, speed, depth, frequeny allocation, etc. Typical mes-
sages might be 20 to 80 characters in length and generally re-
quire transmission no more often than once per second.

The electrical definitions in this standard are not intended to
accommodate high-bandwidth applications such as radar or video
imagery, or intensive databased or file transfer applications.

Since there is no provision for garanteed delivery of messages
and only limited error checking capability, this standard should
be used with caution in critical applications.


1.3 Definitions

1.3.1 General

Common terms are defined in Apendix IV, Glossary, of this Stand-
ard. Where there is a conflict terms shall be interpreted wher-
ever possible in accordance with the references in Section 1.4.


1.3.2 TALKERs

A TALKER is any device which sends data to other devices within
this specification. The type of TALKER is identified by a 2-
character mnemonic as listed in Section 6.2 (Table 4).


1.3.3 LISTENERs

A LISTENER is any device which receives data from another device
within this specification.

                                    Page 04
 3. Hardware Specification

One TALKER and multiple LISTENERS may be connected in parallel
over an interconnecting wire. The number of LISTENERS depends on
the output capability and input drive requirements of individual
devices.


3.1 Interconnecting Wire

Interconnection between devices may be by means of a two-conduc-
tor, shielded, twisted-pair wire.


3.2 Conductor Definitions

The conductors referred to in this standard are the signal lines
"A" and "B", and shield.


3.3 Electrical Connections/Shield Requirements

All signal line "A" connections are connected in parallel with
all device "A" connections and all signal line "B" connections
are connected in parallel with all device "B" connections. The
shield should be connected to the TALKER chassis and should not
be connected at any LISTENER. However, the shield should be
continuos (unbroken) between all listeners.

* A continuous DC path between TALKER and LISTENER signal grounds
* is required as provided for by EIA-422 if EIA-422 receivers are
* used in IEC applications. This path is generally part of the
* equipment safety (or chassis) grounding system.


3.4 Connector

No standard connector is specified. Wherever possible readily
available commercial connectors should be used. Manufacturers
shall provide means for user identification of the connections
used.


3.5 Electrical Signal Characteristics

This section describes the electrical characteristics of trans-
mitters and receivers.


3.5.1 Signal State Definitions

The idle, marking, logical "1", OFF or stop bit state is defined
by a negative voltage on line "A" with respect to line "B".

The active, spacing, logical"0", ON or start bit state is de-
fined by a positive voltage on line "A" with respect to line "B".

Note that the above "A" with respect to "B" levels are inverted
from the voltage input/output requirements of standard UARTs and
that many line drivers and receivers provide a logical inversion.

                                    Page 05
 3.5.2 TALKER Drive Circuits

No provision is made for more than a single TALKER to be connect-
ed to the bus. The drive circuit used to provide the signal "A"
and the return "B" shall meet, at a minimum, the requirements of
EIA-422-A (December 1978).


3.5.3 LISTENER Receive Circuits

Multiple LISTENERs may be connected to a single TALKER. The
LISTENER receive circuit shall consist of an optoisolator and
should have protective circuits to limit current, reverse bias
and power dissipation at the optodiode as shown in Figure 1.
Reference is made to example circuits in Section 7.0 of this
Standard.

The receive circuit shall be designed for operation with a mini-
mum differential input voltage of 2.0 volts and shall not take
more than 2.0 mA from the line at that voltage.

For reasons of compatibility with equipment designed to earlier
versions of this standard, it is noted that the 'idle, marking,
logical "1", OFF or stop bit state' had previously< been defined
to be in the range -15 to +0.5 volts. The active, spacing,
logical "0", ON or start bit state' was defined to be in the
range +4.0 to +15 volts while sourcing not less than 15mA.

* In places of this optoisolator receive circuit the IEC alternately
* allows the use of a differential-receiver that meets the require-
* ments of EIA-422-A (December 1978). This configuration is not
* compatible with equipment designed to meet previous versions of
* this standard that made use of single-ended unbalanced drive
* circuits.

 3.5.4 Electrical Isolation

Within a LISTENER there shall be no direct electrical connection
between the signal line, "A", return line, "B", or shield and
ship's ground or power. Isolation from ships ground is required.


3.5.5 Maximum Voltage on Bus

The maximum applied voltage between signal lines "A" and "B" and
between either line and Ground will be in accordance with the
EIA-422 specification.

For protection against miswiring and for use with earlier TALKER
designes, all receive curcuit devices should be capable of with-
standing 15 volts between signal lines "A" and "B" and between
either line and ground for an indefinite period.


4. Data Transmission

Data is transmitted in serial asynchronous form in accordance
with ANSI standards (reference paragraph 1.4.1). The first bit
is a start bit and is followed by data bits, least-significant-
bit first as illustrared by Figure 2. The following parameters
are used:

          Baud rate    4800
          Data bits    8 (d7 = 0)
          Parity       None
          Stop bits    One

 5. Data Format Protocol


5.1 Characters

All transmitted data shall be interpreted as ASCII characters.
The most significant bit of the 8-bit character shall always be
transmitted as zero (d7 = 0).


5.1.1 Reserved Characters

The reserved character set consist of those ASCII characters
shown in Section 6.1 (Table 1). These characters are used for
specific formatting purposes, such as sentence and field delimit-
ing, and may not be used in data fields.


5.1.2 Valid Characters

The valid character set consist of all printable ASCII charac-
ters (HEX 20 to HEX 7E) except those defined as reserved charc-
ters. Section 6.1 (Table 2) lists the valid character set.


5.1.3 Undefined Characters

ASCII values not specified as either "reserved characters" or
"valid characters" are excluded and may not be transmitted at any
time.


5.1.4 Character Symbols
When individual characters are used in this standard to define
units of measure, indicate the type of data field, type of sen-
tence, etc. they will be interpreted according to the character
symbol table in Section 6.1 (Table 3).


5.2 Fields

A Field consists of a string of valid characters, or no charac-
ters (null field), located between two appropriate delimiter
characters.


5.2.1 Address Field

An address field is the first field in a sentence and follows the
"$" delimiter, it serves to define the sentence. Characters
within the address field are limited to digits and upper case
letters. The address field may not be a null field. Only sen-
tences with the following three types of address fileds may be
transmitted:

                                    Page 08
 5.2.1.1 Approved Address Field

Approved address fields consist of five characters defined by
this standard. The first two characters are the TALKER Identifi-
er, listed in Section 6.2 (Table 4). The next three characters
form the Sentence Formatter used to define the format and the
type of data. Section 6.2 (Table 5) and Appendix I list approved
Sentence Formatters.


5.2.1.2 Query Address Field

The query address consists of five characters and is used for the
purpose of requesting transmission of a specific sentence on a
separate bus from an identified TALKER.

The first two characters are the TALKER Identifier of the device
requesting data, the next two characters are the TALKER Identifi-
er of the device being addressed and the final character is the
query character "Q".


5.2.1.3 Proprietary Address Field

The proprietary address field consists of the proprietary charc-
ter "P" followed by a three-character Manufacturer's Mnemonic
Code, used to identify the TALKER issuing a proprietary sentence,
and any additional characters as required. A list of valid Manu-
facturer's Mnemonic Codes is contained in Appendix III.


5.2.2 Data Fields

Data Fields in approved sentences follow a "," delimiter and con-
tain valid characters in accordance with the formats illustrated
in Section 6.2 (Table 6). Data fields in proprietary sentences
contain only valid characters but are not defined by this stand-
ard.

Because of the presence of variable data fields and null fields,
specific data fileds may only be located within a sentence by ob-
serving the field delimiters ",". Therefore it is essential for
the LISTENER to locate fields by counting delimiters rather than
counting total numbers of characters received from the start of
the sentence.


5.2.2.1 Variable Length Fields

Although some data fields are defined to have fixed length, many
are of variable lenght in order to allow devices to convey infor-
mation and to provide data with more or less precission, according
to the capability or requirements of a particular device.

Variable length fields may be alpha-numeric or numeric fileds.
Variable numeric fields may contain a decimal point and may con-
tain leading or trailing "zeros".

                                    Page 09
 5.2.2.2 Data Field Types

Data fields may be alpha, numeric, alphanumeric, variable length,
fixed length, fixed/variable (with a portion fixed in length
while the remainder varies). Some fields are constant, with
their value dictated by a specific sentence definition. The al-
lowable field types are summarized in section 6.2 (Table 6),
Field Type Summary.


5.2.2.3 Null Fields

A null field is a field of length zero, i.e. no character are
transmitted in the field. Null fields shall be used when the
value is unreliable or not available.

For example, if heading information were not available, sending
data of "000" is misleading because a user cannot sidtinguish
between "000" meaning no data and a legitimate heading of "000".
However, a null field, with no characters at all, clearly indi-
cates that no data is being transmitted.

Null fileds with their delimiters can have the following
appearance depending on where they are located in the sentence:

                 ",,"   ",*"   ",<CR><LF>"

The ASCII NULL character (HEX 00) shall not be used as the null
field.


5.2.3 Checksum Field

A checksume filed may optionally be transmitted in any sentence.
However some approved sentences specifically require the checksum
field. The checksum field is the last field in a sentence and
follows the checksum delimiter character "*".

The checksum is the 8-bit exclusive OR (no start or stop bits) of
all characters in the sentence, including "," delimiters, between
but not including the "$" and the "*" delimiters.

The hexadecimal value of the most significant and least signifi-
cant 4 bits of the result are converted to two ASCII characters
(0-9, A-F) for transmission. The most significant character is
transmitted first.


5.3 Sentences

This section describes the general structure of sentences. De-
tails of specific sentences may specify restrictions beyond the
general limitations given in this part of the standard. Such re-
strictions may include defining some fields as fixed length, nu-
meric or text only, required to be non-null, transmitted with a
certain frequency, etc.

                                    Page 10
 The maximum number of characters in a sentence shall be 82, con-
sisting of a maximum of79 characters between the starting delim-
iter "$" and the terminating <CR><LF>.

The minimum number of fields in a sentence is one (1). The first
field shall be an address field containing the identity of the
TALKER and the sentence formatter which specifies the number of
data fields in the sentence, the type of data they contain and
the order in which the data fields are transmitted. The remain-
ing portion of the sentence may contain zero or multiple data
fields.

The maximum number of fields allowed in a single sentence is lim-
itetd only by the maximum sentence length of 82 characters. Null
fields may be presented in the sentence and shall always be used if
data for that field is unavailable.

All sentences bebin with the sentence start delimiter character
"$" and end with the sentence termination delimiter <CR><LF>.


5.3.1 Approved Sentences

Approved sentences are those designed for general use and de-
tailed in this Standard. Approved sentences are listed in Sec-
tion 6.3 and Appendix I of the current version of the Standard.
Preferred sentences are contain in Section 6.3 and these sen-
tences should be used wherever possible. Appendix I contains
sentences that may be phased-out of use, are not recommend for
new designes, but may be met in practise.

An approved sentence contains, in the order shown, the following
elements:

   "$"                    HEX 24  -  Start of sentence
   <address  field>       TALKER identifier and sentence formatter
   [","<data field>]      Zero or more data fields
         .
         .
         .
   [","<data field>]
   ["*"<checksum field>]  Optional checksum field
   <CR><LF>               Hex 0D 0A  - End of sentence

 5.3.1.1 Approved Sentence Structure

The following provides a summary explanation of the approved
sentence structure:       $aaccc,c--c*hh<CR><LF>

ASCII         HEX     DESCRIPTION

                      identifying type of TALKER, and Sentence
                      Formatter. The first two characters iden-
                      tify the TALKER. The last three are the
                      Sentence Formatter mnemonic code identify-
                      ing the data type and the string formt of
                      the successive Fields. Mnemonics will be
                      used as far as posible to facilitate
                      readouts by users.

","           2C      Field delmiter. Starts each Field except
                      Address and Checksum fields. If it is
                      followed by a null field, it is all that
                      remainsto indicate no data in field.

                      by 3rd and subsequent characters of the
                      address field (the "Sentence Formatter").
                      Data fields may be of variable length and
                      are preceded by delimiters ",".

"*"           2A      Optional Checksum Delimiter. Follows
                      last Data field of the sentence. It indi-
                      cates that the following two alpha-numeric
                      characters show the HEX value of the CHECK-
                      SUM.

                      each character in the Sentence, between,
                      but excluding "$" and "*". The hexadecimal
                      value of the most significant and least
                      significant 4 bits of the result are con-
                      verted to two ASCII characters (0-9, A-F)
                      for transmission. The most significant
                      character is transmitted first. The
                      "CHECKSUM" field is optional, except when
                      indicated as mandatory.

<CR><LF>      0D 0A   Terminates Sentence.

 5.3.2 Query Sentences

Query sentences are intended to request Approved sentences to be
transmittetd from a TALKER on a seperate bus in a form of two way
communication.

The approved Query sentence contains, in the order shown, the
following elements:

  "$"                    HEX 24 - Start of sentence
  <aa>                   TALKER Identifier or requester
  <aa>                   TALKER Identifier for device from which
                         data is being requested
  "Q"                    Query character identifies Query address
  ","                    Data field delimiter
  <ccc>                  Approved sentence formatter of data
                         being requested
  ["*"<checksum field>]  Optional checksum field
  <CR><LF>               HEX 0D 0A - End of sentence


5.3.2.1 Reply to Query Sentence

The reply on a seperate bus to a Query sentence is the Approved
sentence that was requested. The use of Query sentences requires
cooperation between the devices that are interconnected, a reply
to a Query sentence is not mandatory and there is no specified
time delay between the receipt of a query and the reply.


5.3.3 Proprietary Sentences

Proprietary sentences provide a means for manufacturers to use
the sentence structure definitions of this standard to transfer
data which does not fall within the scope of approved sentences.
This will generally be for one of the following reasons:

        -Data is intended for another device from the same manu-
         facturer, is device specific, and not in a form or of a
         type of interest to the general user;

        -Data is being used for test purposes prior to the adop-
         tion of approved sentences;

        -Data is not of a type and general usefulness which
         merits the creation of an approved sentence.

A proprietary sentence contains, in the order shown, the follow-
ing elements:

         "$"                    Hex 24 - Start of sentence
         "P"                    Hex 50 - Proprietary sentence ID
         <aaa>                  Manufacturer's Mnemonic code
         [<valid characters, manufacturer's data>]
         ["*"<checksum field>]  Optional checksum field
         <CR><LF>               Hex 0D 0A - End of sentence

                                    Page 13
 Beyond limiting overall sentence length are requiring the use of
only valid characters, details of proprietary data fields will
not be included in this standard and need not be submitted for
approval. However it is required that such sentences be pub-
lished in the manufacturer's manuals for reference.


5.3.4 Valid Sentences

Approved sentences, Query sentences and Proprietary sentences are
the only valid sentences. Sentences of any other form are non-
valid and shall not be transmitted on the bus.


5.3.5 Sentences Transmission Timing

Frequency of sentence transmission when specified shall be in
accordance with the approved sentence definitions (Section 6.3 and
Appendix I): When not specified, the rate should be consistent
with the basic measurement or calculation cycle but generally
not more frequently than once per second.

It is desirable that sentences be transmitted with minimum inter-
character spacing, preferably as a near continuous burst, but under
no circumstance shall the time to complete the transmission of a
sentence be greater than 1 second.


5.3.6 Additions to Approved Sentences

In order to allow for improvements or additions, future revisions
of this Standard may modify existing sentences by adding new data
fields after the last data field but before the optional checksum
delimiter character "*" and checksum field. LISTENERs should
determine the end of the sentence by recognition of "<CR><LF>"
and "*" rather than by counting field delimiters. The checksum
value should be computed on all received characters between, but
not including, "$" and "*" whether or not the LISTENER recognizes
all fields.

*MWV - Wind Speed and Angle

        When the Reference Field is set to Relative, data is provded giving
        the wind angle in relation to the vessel's headig and wind speed,
        both relative to the (moving) vessel.
        When the Reference Field is set to True, data is provided giving the
        wind angle relative to the vessel's heading and wind speed, both with
        reference to the (moving) water. True wind is the vector sum of the
        Relative (Apparent) wind vector and the vessel's velocity vector
        along the heading line of the vessel. It represents the wind at the
        vessel if it were stationary relative to the water and heading in the
        same direction.

These examples are intended as samples of correct constructed sentences.
They are representative samples only and show part of the wide range of
legal variations possible with sentences. They should not necessarily be
used as templates for sentences.


7.1.1 Example #1, Loran-C LAT/LONG

This example gives present position in Lat-Long, as determined by LoranC.
The 3 character mnemonic in the address, GLL, indicates that the data is
present position in Lat.-Long. The time (UTC) of the position fix is 09
hours, 13 minutes and 42 seconds. Decimal seconds are not available and
the decimal point is optionally omitted. There are no warning flags set in
the navigation receiver as indicated by Status = 'A'.

 7.1.3 Example #3 - Proprietary Sentence

A proprietary sentence has the following general format:

     |<--- 80 character Sentence or less --->|
     v                                       v

     $Paaa-----------------------------------<CR><LF>
     || | |                                  |   |
     || | +--> data, 75 character maximum <--+   +--> End of sentence
     || |
     || +----> 3 character manufacturer's mnemonic code
     ||
     |+------> Proprietary sentence identifier
     |
     +-------> Start of sentence


A specific example will have little meaning to someone other than
the particular manufacturer that designed the sentence:


     $PSRDA003[470738][1224523]???RST47,3809,A004*47<CR><LF>

            Sentences Not Recommended for New Designs



The following identifiers and senteces are scheduled to be phased out
of use and are no longer recommended for sole use in new or revised
designs. The senteces are valid sentences, but due to changing
circumstances it is desirable to delete or replace these sentences as
indicated below.

Generally in each of the sentence descriptions below reference is made
to a sentence in the current Version of the standard, manufacturers
are urged to use the currently recommended sentence in new or revised
designs. It is desirable that manufacturers provide both new and old
sentences whenever possible for a period of time that will serve as a
phase-in period for the new sentences.

                                     GLOSSARY





accuracy - in navigation, a measure of the error between the
 point desired and the point achieved, or between the position in-
 dicated by measurement and the true position [compare with preci-
 sion].

address field - for sentences in this standard, the fixed length
 field following the beginning sentence delimiter "$" (HEX 24).
 For approved sentences, composed of a two character talker iden-
 tifier and a three character sentence formatter. For proprietary
 sentences, composed of the charcter "P" (HEX 50) followed by a
 three character manufacturer identification code.

additional secondary factor - in Loran-C, a correction in addi-
 tion to the secondary phase factor correction for the additional
 time (or phase delay) for transmission of a low frequency signal
 over a composite land-seawater path when the signal transit time
 is based on the free-space velocity.

apparent wind - (see 'relative wind').

approved sentence - a sentence which has been approved for gener-
 al use by the NMEA general assembly and is listed in this stand-
 ard and attached Appendices.

arrival alarm - an alarm signal issued by a voyage tracking unit
 which indicates arrival at or at a pre-determined distance from a
 waypoint. - (see 'arrival circle')

arrival circle - an artificial boundary placed around the desti-
 nation waypoint of the present navigation leg, the entering of
 which will signal an arrival alarm.

arrival perpendicular - crossing of the line which is perpendicu-
 lar to the course line and which passes through the destination
 waypoint.

azimuth - the horizontal direction of a celestial point from a
 terrestrial point, expressed as the angular distance from a ref-
 erence direction, usually measured from 000deg at the reference di-
 rection clockwise through 360deg.


                                            Page IV-1
 ASCII - American Standard Code for Information Interchange. A 7
 bit wide serial code describing numbers, upper and lower case al-
 pha, characters, special and non-printing charcters. See Ameri-
 can National Standards Institute documents ANSI X 3.15, ANSI X
 3.16 and ANSI X 3.4.

atomic time - time obtained by counting the cycles of a signal in
 resonance with certain kinds of atoms.

autopilot - an automatic device for steering a vessel so as to
 maintain its heading in an intended direction. Mechanical means
 are used to steer the rudder. A radio navigation system is often
 connected to correct for track errors, or to select new destina-
 tions.

bearing - the horizontal direction of one terrestrial point from
 another, expressed as the angular distance from a reference di-
 rection, usually measured from 000deg at the reference direction
 clockwise through 360deg.

Beaufort wind scale - a numerical scale for indicating wind
 speed. Beaufort numbers (or forces) range from force 0 (calm) to
 force 12 (hurricane).

blink - in Loran-C, a signal used to indicate that a station is
 malfunctioning. Intended to prevent use of that signal for navi-
 gation.

checksum - for this standard, a validity check performed on the
 data contained in the sentence, calculated by the talker, ap-
 pended to the message, when recalculated by the listener for com-
 parison to determine if the message was received correctly. Re-
 quired for some sentences, optional for all others.

communication protocoll - a method established for message trans-
 fer between a talker and a listener which includes the message
 format and the sequence in which the message are to be trans-
 ferred. Also includes the signaling requirements such as baud
 rate, stop bits, parity, and bits per character.

course - the horizontal direction in which a vessel is steered or
 intended to be steered, expressed as angular distance from north,
 usually from 000deg at north, clockwise through 360deg. Strictly,
 the term applies to direction through the water, not the direc-
 tion intended to be made good over the ground (see 'track'). Dif-
 fers from heading.

course over ground (COG) - term used to refer to the direction of
 the path over ground actually followed by a vessel [a misnomer in
 that courses are directions steered or intended to be steered
 through the water with respect to a reference meridian].

cross track error (XTE) - the distance from the vessel's present
 position to the closest point on a line between the origin and
 destination waypoints of the navigation leg being travelled.


                                            Page IV-2
 cycle lock - in Loran-C, the comparison, in time difference, be-
 tween corresponding carrier cycles contained in the rise times of
 a master and slave station pulse is called cycle match. This
 value when refined to a determination of the phase difference be-
 tween these two cycles results in cycle lock. (See also 'en-
 velope-to-cycle distortion').

data field - in an NMEA 0183 sentence, a field which contains a
 data value.

dead reckoning - the process of determining the position of a
 vessel at any instant by applying to the last well-determined po-
 sition (point of departure or subsequent fix) the run that has
 since been made, usually based on the recent history of speed and
 heading measurements.

Decca chain - a group of associated stations of the Decca Naviga-
 tor System. A Decca chain normally consists of a master and
 three slave stations. Each slave station is called by the color
 of associated pattern of hyperbolic lines as printed on the
 chart, i.e., red slave, green slave, purple slave.

Decca Navigator System - a short to medium range low frequency
(70-130 kHz) radionavigation system by which a hyperbolic line of
 position of high accuracy is obtained. The system is an arrange-
 ment of fixed, phase locked, continuous wave transmitters operat-
 ing on harmonically related frequencies and special receiving
 equipment located on a vessel.

delimiter - in this standard, a character or characters used to
 separate fields or sentences. The following delimiters are used
 in this standard:

      field delimiters    - ASCII "$" (HEX 24) for address  fields
                          - ASCII "," (HEX 2C) for data     fields
                          - ASCII "*" (HEX 2A) for checksum field

      sentence delimiters - carriage return <CR> and line feed
                            <LF> (HEX 0D0A)
           [note: a <CR><LF> is not required preceding the first
                  sentence transmitted]

depth sounder - an instrument which determines the depth of water
 by measuring the time interval between the emissions of a sound
 and the return of its echo from the bottom.

destination - the immediate geographic point of interest to
 which a vessel is navigating. It may be the next waypoint along
 a route of waypoints or the final destination of a voyage.

deviation - the angle between the magnetic meridian and the axis
 of a compass card, expressed in degrees east or west to indicate
 direction in which the northern end of the compass card is offset
 from magnetic north.


                                            Page IV-3
 Doppler speed log - an instrument which measures the relative mo-
 tion between a vessel and the reflective sea bottom (for bottom
 return mode) or suspended particulate matter in the seawater it-
 self (for water return mode) by measuring the frequency shifts
 between a transmitted and subsequently echoed acoustic or elec-
 tromagnetic signal.

drift - the speed of a current.

echo sounder - (see 'depth sounder').

envelope-to-cycle distortion (ECD) - the time relationship be-
 tween the phase of the Loran-C carrier and the time origin of the
 envelope waveform.

field - in this standard, a character or string of characters im-
 mediately preceded by a field delimiter (see 'delimiters').

fixed field - in this standard, a field in which the number of
 characters is fixed. For data fields, such fields are shown in
 the sentence definitions with no decimal point. Other fields
 which fall into this category are the address field and the
 checksum field (if present).

geoid - a surface along whith the gravity potential is everywhere
 equal (equipotential surface) and to which the direction of
 gravity is always perpendicular.

geometric dilution of precision (GDOP) - a value representing all
 geometric factors that degrade the accuracy of a position fix
 which has been derived from a navigation system.

Global Positioning System (GPS) - (full name NAVSTAR Global Posi-
 tioning System) an all-weather, continuous satellite navigation
 system being developed by the Department of Defense under Air
 Force management. The fully deployed operational system is in-
 tended to provide highly accurate position and velocity informa-
 tion in three dimensions and precise time and time interval on a
 global basis, to an unlimited number of authorized users. Al-
 though developed primarily for military missions, current policy
 calls for civil availability with a degradation in system accura-
 cy in order to protect U.S. national security interests.

great circle - the intersection of the surface of a sphere and a
 plane through its center.

great circle chart - a chart on which a great circle appears as a
 straight line or approximately so.

great circle direction - horizontal direction of a great circle,
 expressed as angular distance from a reference direction.

group repetition interval (GRI) - of a particular Loran-C chain,
 the specified time interval for all stations of the chain to
 transmit their pulse groups. For each chain a minimum group

                                            Page IV-4
 repetition interval is selected of sufficient duration to provide
 time for each station to transmit its pulse group and additional
 time between each pulse group so that signals from two or more
 stations cannot overlap in time anywhere within the coverage
 area.

gyrocompass - a compass having one or more gyroscopes as the di-
 rective element, and which is north-seeking. Its operation de-
 pends upon four natural phenomena: gyroscopic inertia, gyroscop-
 ic precession, the earth's rotation, and gravity.

gyropilot - an automatic device for steering a vessel by means of
 control signals received from gyrocompass (see 'autopilot').

gyroscope - a rapidly rotating mass free to move about one or
 both axes perpendicular to the axis of rotation and to each oth-
 er.

heading - the horizontal direction in which a ship actually
 points or heads at any instant, expressed in angular units from a
 reference direction, usually from 000deg at the reference direction
clockwise through 360deg. (See 'true heading' and 'magnetic heading')


heading-to-steer - the difference between the bearing to destina-
 tion (from present position) and track-made-good, applied to the
 bearing to the destination to produce a heading that will guide
 the vessel to the destination.

horizontal dilution of precision (HDOP) - similar to GDOP, except
 elevation factors are ignored.

keel - a longitudinal timber or plate extending along the center
 of the bottom of a ship and often projecting from the bottom.

line of position (LOP) - in Loran or Decca navigation systems, a
 vector obtained by measurement of the time difference between the
 receipt of the master and slave signals which is then used to se-
 lected a corresponding LOP from a chart or table, Two or more
 intersecting LOP's are required to obtain a position fix.

listener - in this standard, the recipient of message across
 the interconnecting link.

log - an instrument for measuring the speed or distance or both
 traveled by a vessel.

Loran - the general designation of one group of radionavigation
 systems by which a hyperbolic line of position is determined
 through measuring the difference in the times of reception of
 synchronized pulse signals from two fixed transmitters.

magnetic bearing - bearing relative to magnetic north; compass
 bearing corrected for deviation.


                                            Page IV-5
 magnetic heading - heading relative to magnetic north.


manufacturer identification code - in this standard, a three
 character manufacturer identifier, usually an acronym derived
 from the company name, which has been approved and is listed in
 Appendix III, for use by a manufacturer as part of the address
 field in formulation of proprietary sentences.

Mercator map projection - a conformal cylindrical map projection
 in which the surface of a sphere or spheroid, such as earth, is
 conceived as developed on a cylinder tangent along the equator.
 Meridias appear as equally spaced vertical lines and parallels
 as horizontal lines drawn farther apart as the latitude and
 longitude scales at any point is maintained. Also known as Mer-
 cator map projection.

Navigation Leg - the portion of a voyage upon which the vessel
 currently travels. Each leg consists of two waypoints, an ORIGIN,
 a DESTINATION, and a line between between them, upon which the vessel
 travels.

Navy Navigation Satellite System (TRANSIT) - an operational
 satellite navigation system of the united States conceived and
 developed by the Applied Physics Laboratory of John Hopkins
 University for the U.S. Navy. It is an all-weather, worldwide,
 and passive system used primarily for the navigation of surface
 ships and submarines. Also known by the acronyms NAVSAT or
 TRANSIT, it consists of a constellation of orbiting satellites, a
 ground system of tracking stations, and any number of user sta-
 tions (navigators). The user stations are radionavigation de-
 vices composed of a receiver, a frequency cycle-counter, and a
 computer. The minimum constellation for system operation is four
 satellites (five satellites in orbit provide redundancy). The
 satellite orbits are controlled by the tracking stations. Satel-
 lites broadcast current known positions while orbiting the earth.
 The NAVSAT system utilizes the Doppler shift of radio signals
 transmitted from the satellite to measure the relative velocity
 between the satellite and the navigator. Knowing the satellite
 orbit precisely, the navigator's absolute position can be accu-
 rately determined from this time rate of change of range to the
 satellite.

null field - in this standard, indicates that data is not avail-
 able for the field. Indicated by two ASCII commas, i.e., ",,"
 (HEX 2C2C), or, for the last data field in a sentence, one comma
 followed by either the checksum delimiter "*" (HEX 2A) or the
 sentce delimiters <CR><LF> (HEX 0D0A). [Note: the ASCII Null
 character (HEX 00) is not to be used for null fields!]

Omega Navigation System - a worldwide, continuous, radionaviga-
 tion system of medium accuracy which provides hyperbolic lines of
 position through phase comparisons of VLF (10-14kHz) continuous
 wave signals transmitted on a common frequency on a time-shared
 basis. The fully implemented system is comprised of only eight
 transmitting stations.


                                            Page IV-6
 one-way communication protocol - a protocol established between a
 talker and a listener in which only the talker may send messages
 [compare to 'two-way communication protocol'].

origin waypoint - the starting point of the present navigation
 leg.

precision - a measure of how close the outcome of a series of ob-
 servations or measurements cluster about some estimated value of
 a desired quantity, such as the average value of a series of ob-
 servations of a quantity. Precision implies repeatability of
 the observations within some specified limit and depends upon the
 random errors encountered due to the quality of the observing
 equipment, the skill of the observer and randomly fluctuating
 conditions such as temperature, pressure, refraction, ect. [com-
 pare with 'accuracy'].

proprietary sentence - a sentence to be sent across the intercon-
 necting link which is not included in the List of Approved Sen-
 tences of this standard. All proprietary sentences sent over the
 interconnecting link shall contain a unique talker identifier
 which bwgins with a "P" (HEX 50) followed by a three character
 manufacturer identification code.

relative bearing - bearing relative to heading or to vessel.

relative wind - the speed and relative direction from which the
 wind appears to blow with reference to a moving point (also
 called apparent wind).

rhumb line - a line on the surface of the earth making the same
 oblique angle with allmeridians. A rhumb line is a straight
 line on a rhumb (or Mercator) projection.

rhumb direction - the horizontal direction of a rhumb line, ex-
 pressed as angular distance from a refernce direction. Also
 known as Mercator direction. (See Mercator map projection).

RMa sentence - Recommended Minimum Acceptable sentence, a compos-
 ite sentence recommended by this standard to insure interopera-
 bility between talkers and listeners and to insure that all data
 considered necessary for navigation is sent by a particular navi-
 gation unit.

route - a planned course of travel, usually composed of more than
 one navigation leg.

route system - any system of one or more routes and/or routing
 measures aimed at reducing the risk of casualties schemes, rec-
 ommended tracks, restricted areas, inshore traffic zones, etc.

semi-fixed field - data fields having a base other than 10, but
 use base 10 to express precision of the final term (such as
 minutes expressed as units with a decimal trailer instead of sec-

                                            Page IV-7
  onds in a base 60 field, or seconds expressed with a decimal
 trailer).


selected waypoint - the waypoint currently selected to be the
 point toward which the vessel is travelling. Also called "TO"
 Waypoint, destination or destination waypoint.


sentence formatter - in this standard, a three charcter sentence
 identifier which follows the talker identifier ans is included as
 part of the address field. The sentence formatters are an inte-
 gral part of the sentence definitions provided by this standard
 and attached appendices.

set - the direction towards which a current flows.

speed log - an instrument for measuring a vessel's speed through
 water and/or speed over ground. Asingle axis speed log normally
 measures speed along the longitudinal (fore/aft) axis of the ves-
 sel, while a dual axis speed log measures speed along the trans-
 verse (port/starboeard) axis as well. (Also see 'Doppler speed
 log').

speed made good - the adjusted speed which takes into account
 factors such as drift and wind speed. Can be estimated or comput-
 ed ny a navigation receiver.

speed over ground (SOG) - the speed of a vessel along the actual
 path of travel over the ground.

signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) - the ratio of the magnitude of a
 signal to that of the noise (interference), often expressed in
 decibels.

talker - in the NMEA 0183 Standard, the originator of messages
 across an NMEA 0183 link.

talker identifier - the first two characters following the "$"
 (HEX 24) in an NMEA 0183 sentence (address character 1 and 2);
 selected from Table - Talker Identifier, Mnemonics of the NMEA
 0183 Standard.

time difference (TD) - in Loran-C, the time difference measured
 from the time of reception of the master station signal to the
 time of reception of the slave station signal.

track - the intended or desired horizontal direction of travel
 with respect to the earth. The track expressed in degrees of the
 compass may differ from the course due to allowence made in the
 course for such factors as sea and weather conditions in order to
 resume the desired track (see 'track made good').

track made good - the single resultant direction from a point of
 departure to a point of arrival at any given time.


                                            Page IV-8
 transducer - a device that converts one type of energy to anoth-
 er, as a loudspeaker that changes electrical energy into acousti-
 cal energy.

true bearing - bearing relative to true north; compass bearing
 corrected for compass error.

true heading - heading relative to true north.

to-way-communication protocol - a protocol established between a
 talker and a listener in which the listener may also issue re-
 quests to the talker when required [compare to 'one-way communica-
 tion protocol].

UART - Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter which produces
 an electrical signal and timing for transmission of data over a 
 communication path, and circuitry for detection and capture of
 such data transmitted from another UART.

Iniversal Time Coordinated (UTC) - a time scale based on the ro-
 tation of the earth which is disseminated by most broadcast time
 services [compare with 'atomic time'].

variable field - in NMEA 0183 sentences, a data field which may
 or may not contain a decimal point depending on the requirements
 and the accuracy of the measuring device (talker).

variation - the angle between the magnetic and geographic merid-
 ians at any place, expressed in degrees and minutes east or west
 to indicate the direction of magnetic north from true north.

waypoint - a reference point on a track.
