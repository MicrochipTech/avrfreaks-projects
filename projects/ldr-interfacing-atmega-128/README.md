## Summary

This is my first project that uses a ADC.This project is based on ATmega 128 @16Mhz. A LRD is connected at port F on channel 0, the ADC is configured in free running mode and is left adjusted so only ADCH register is read. The output is at Port C where 8 leds are connected. If the light falling on LDR is more no. of led glowing are less and vice-versa. The value of ADCH is show on the LCD.Rest of the details can be found in the code.
