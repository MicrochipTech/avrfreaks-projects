## Summary

This program shows you how to read the humidity value from the HIH 6130 sensor, by Honeywell. It communicates through the TWI (I2C) protocol. The ATxmega128 microcontroller uses TWI functions developped by SpinMos to read the humidity's value. These TWI functions are written for general purposes and they can be applied at any other program or project.
