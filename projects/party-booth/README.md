## Summary

The first time I saw the [Big Dome Push Button](http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9181) on sparkfun.com, I immediately thought of this application.


You see, one of my client is a photography studio. One service provided by the studio during events is what they call the "[PhotoMate](http://www.studiocasagrande.com/html/events/animation/index.php?lang=en)", which is a box containing a DSLR, a MacBook Pro, and a remote shutter release.


This little device replaces the remote shutter release, as well as the self-timer, with a better user-interface.
