## Summary

The project is with microcontroller Atmega32.  

The complete code includes:


1. AVRStudio complete code:  

In the code the ADC input has been taken from adc pin 1 and 2. There is switch attached with the adc pin 2 and the number of increment of on/off of the switch will send to computer through UART. In LCD, the adc value of adc pin 1 & 2 will display. 


2. Proteus file.:  

The actual ckt will consit of TTL converter ckt in uart output.  

In proteus the uart pin is connected to D9M element to test the actual data in PC. For this one virtual serial port splitter is required.


3. VB code for reading D9 port:  

The VB code will show the incremented number, which is the number of times the switch is on and off. Also, the vb application will store the value in a txt file.
