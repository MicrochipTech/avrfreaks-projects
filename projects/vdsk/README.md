## Summary

The VDsk Block Driver allows you to use an Amic Flash chip (e.g. an A25L40, an A25L040 or an A25L080) as a proper block-level read-write device, by abstracting the underlying Flash hardware.


It requires only 1.5Kb of compiled code and 0.5Kb of SRAM when compiled with -Os.


Source code is attached, along with some lower-level underlying Amic Flash source. Makefiles are not included.


The VDsk Block driver is part of the FIGnition DIY 8-bit computer firmware from revision 0.7.0,

Note: A new revision of the underlying code will be published when all of the FIGNition source code is released.
