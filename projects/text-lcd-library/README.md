## Summary

Library for Hitachi 44780 based 1 or 2 line Text LCD displays. This code uses 6 bits for the display, and in the included demo the 2 last bits are used for switches giving feedback to the display. The demo is small, but shows how easy it can be to talk with an LCD display.


It should also be easy to port to other C compilers...
