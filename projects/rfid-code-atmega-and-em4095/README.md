# RFID code for ATmega and EM4095

Uploaded by michalvanka on 2007-06-16 10:05:00 (rating 0 out of 5)

## Summary

This is the first GNU/GPL RFID firmware ever.


It was written mainly for ERFID1 board but it  

can work with any EM4095 based radio connected  

to ATmega8 MCU.


Connection between ATmega and EM4095  

(where the CLK and DEMOD\_OUT signals  

from EM4095 chip go) is described in em4095ro.S file.


Enjoy.
