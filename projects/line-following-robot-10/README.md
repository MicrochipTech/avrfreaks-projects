## Summary

I have made a line follower robot. i have used atmega32 as microcontroller and the sensors include led and photodiode.  

the logic is very simple. i placed the two sensors on the white background with the black line between them. i used an adc for the sensors output and accordingly put my logic - the sensor which is off,turn the bot same side. the pwm in this case is also kept low.


i m giving you the code.
