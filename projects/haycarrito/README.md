## Summary

I am making a small car (kind of the RC ones) that will be controlled over internet using the accelerometers of an android phone.


Comments, questions, improvements welcome :D


Using an atmega128.  

The Wifi module im using: [http://www.elechouse.com/elechou...](http://www.elechouse.com/elechouse/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=90_186&products_id=1007)  

The wifi is connected via UART to the atmega128, and controlled via AT commands.  

Compiler: avr-gcc for linux.
