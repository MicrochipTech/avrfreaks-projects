## Summary

Moved to Atmel spaces  

[http://spaces.atmel.com/gf/proje...](http://spaces.atmel.com/gf/project/twi/frs/)


TWI code for master and slave mode of I2C.  

This code is written in C for avr-gcc.  

This code is an interrupt driven implementation of the TWI.


A demo program is included (with AVR studio 4 project files).  

The demo program was compiled for an Atmega324P and should work  

with other dual UART AVR's without needing to edit the demo c file.
