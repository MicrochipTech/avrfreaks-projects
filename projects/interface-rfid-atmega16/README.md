## Summary

Knowingly or unknowingly the RFID technology is used by us in our day to day life. The most familiar example is seen in MNCs, schools and offices for daily attendance or automatic door opening system. The RFID contains two parts, namely, tag and receiver modem. When an RFID tag comes in the range of receiver, the tag gets activated and transmits its unique identification code to the receiver module.


The output of the RFID receiver is the unique ID in either serial (RS232) or wiegand format. Most of the receivers are equipped with additional hardware to send the extracted code in the above format, which can then be used by digital signal processors. This article shows the interfacing of ATmega16 with RFID
