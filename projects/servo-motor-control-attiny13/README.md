## Summary

The timer 0 of attiny13 is set for 50HZ frequency. Using a POT connected to ADC pin PB4 is scan continously and update ADC\_VAL, based on the ADC value, The ontime of PWM is varied and the speed of the fan is controlled. 


To drive the fan with proper current, we can used MOSFET with pullup voltage required.
