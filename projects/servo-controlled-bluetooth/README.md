## Summary

This is a project I made for school. It is a controller for blinds. It consists of an atmega board, with a servo and a light sensor, which is connected to the computer via an USB-Serial adapter. On the PC you can view the light level and control the servo position. You can also connect an Android terminal to the PC via Bluetooth (SPP) and command the servo or view the light level.


I could've used a dedicated bluetooth module for the communication between the phone and the atmega board, but those were the instructions :)


For some reason I can't add link as a file so I will add it here:
