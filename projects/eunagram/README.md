## Summary

This project was done in association with Aditya Bhatt.


The project was done on STK500 kit, using the Atmel ATMega 16 microcontroller. The eUnagram takes in any jumbled word through the on board switches. The alphabets can be entered just like a mobile keypad. We sort of made a mobile keypad, having 4 alphabets on a single key. Right now the keypad has alphabets, space and a backspace. It does not have Numbers and special characters. We detect the key press using polling. After giving the jumbled word, the code searches for a match in a hashed dictionary that has been hardcoded in the source code. If it finds a match, the words are shown on an LCD. We have used the LCD library by Peter Fleury for working with the LCD.
