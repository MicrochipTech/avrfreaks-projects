## Summary

The last weeks I felt having to do some nonsense project. Watching the neighbors putting out their (more or less boring) chirstmas illuminations,  

I decided to build my own. Well, my version is suited for a small tree I'll have on my desk, but it's more like an aquarium. No fixed patterns, smooth random fade in an out, you can watch it for a while and calm down....  

Well, technically it's simply fading in and out a couple of leds with random maximum brightness, random fade in/out rates and random delays in between. But it looks better than I thought.  

Take a Tiny26 (1$) 15LEDs and resistors (1$) a breadboard and ~ 2 hrs of spare time ....
