# AVRDragon enclosure / case

## Summary

Atmel offers a very low cost in-circuit-emulator called the AVRDragon. Unfortunately, it does not have an enclosure, so one needs to be careful not to short out the ICE with an errant bit of clipped wire or something.


The lid has a hole in it so the status LEDs can be seen. 


This was my first project with a new Makerbot Replicator.
