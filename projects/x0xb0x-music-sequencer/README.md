# x0xb0x - music sequencer

Uploaded by ladyada on 2005-06-18 01:36:00 (rating 0 out of 5)

## Summary

The x0xb0x firmware drives a fully functional keyboard-based sequencer that controls the x0xb0x analog circuitry (a bassline synthesizer). Tons of functionality (10 sequencer modes, some with submodes), IO (UART/USB, full octave keyboard, rotary encoder, rotary switchs, MIDI in out thru, DINSYNC), and control (UART/USB interface). Uses just about everything in the ATMega162 except the PWM module and kitchen sink.
