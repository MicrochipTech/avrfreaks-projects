## Summary

Hi,  

I have a program that I would like to use as a bootloader. The program was working with ICCAVR V6 and the ATmega128 chip. Since then we have changed to the ATmega2561 and ICCAVR V8. The code compiles and runs fine as application code. When I run and compile it as bootloader it keeps on resetting. Without getting into too many details is there something obvious I am missing when compiling to application/bootloader code. This is code that was previously working on the ATmega128 with ICCAVR V6. Any ideas would be appreciated. Thanks, Draper
