## Summary

TWI routines in assembly, built with AVRstudio4. A TWI master adressing multiple devices. This TWI service is intended to perform in a multi-tasking system while making very little use of system resources. Hence, the program does not contain any wait-cycles or delay loops. In fact, this was the most important reason for me to go through the trouble of developing this code.
