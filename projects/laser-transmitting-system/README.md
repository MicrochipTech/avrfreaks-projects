## Summary

Well, at the sender, you can type a short text, shown at a 2x20 LCD. When pushing the "send"-button, this text will be coded with the Manchester-Method and sent with a laser-diode of a laser-pointer. A problem: You have to aim quiet good... The receiver operates with a photo-diode, working together with an OpAmp which makes an useful voltage for the AVR. (I used 2 Mega8)  

The received Text will be shown at an Nokia-3330 Display.  

It took mee exactly 2 months so far. I calculated that I can transfer 135 Bytes/second. (Mega8: 6 Mhz).  

In the attachment, you will find pictures, schematics, a german description and the Bascom-Code. 


I don`t have Cases yet, but I will build them out of acrylic-glass, thats the only non-finished-stuff.. :)


Edit: Now, I built the Cases. You can find them in the attachment.
