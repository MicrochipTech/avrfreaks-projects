# FATFS for XMEGA

## Summary

This is a converted version of Chan's FATFS for XMEGA family. The code was written for my own XMEGA starter kit. A 20x4 HD44780 based lcd is connected to board. After reset, the lcd shows the type of detected mmc/SDC/SDHC and then a test file is created and a simple text write/read to file is performed. Code and starter kit simplified schematic are attached.


Dec 2012: Some bugs fixed. Also a new HD44780-based lcd library with 9 size support is used.
