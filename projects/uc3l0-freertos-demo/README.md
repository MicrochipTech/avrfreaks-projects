# UC3L0 FreeRTOS Demo

## Summary

Not finding good demos out there for FreeRTOS and the UC3L0, I made one to learn the architecture for a project.  

This demo provides:  

Full USART Command Terminal  

Configurable ADC Task  

PWM control over RGB LEDs (on the L0 Xplained)  

Printable Data from various sources.


More is possibly planned if I'm able, but it currently works very well.
