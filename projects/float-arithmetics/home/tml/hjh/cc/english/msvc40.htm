<h2>Compilation with MSVC40</h2>
Preparation of the Compiler (only once after a standard installation) :
<ol>
<li>Menu [Tools] [Options] [Directories] Include-Files, there my private header
subdirectory (C:\HOME\CC\INCLUDE) has to be added.</ol>

Creation of a Project for a main program (is only neccesary if that main
program should be debugged)
<ol>
<li>Menu [File] [New] [Project Workspace] [Button OK]
<li>Usually I select WIN32, so the windows sockets can be used (and some other
extensions as long file names)
<li>If you want to create a Console Application, then use as subdirectory C:\HOME\CC\xxx\MDOS40,
if you want to create an Application then use as subdirectory C:\HOME\CC\xxx\MSVC40,
(as I did) then i a subdirectory the 3 Files xxx.mdp, xxx.mak and xxx.ncb
will be created. Under this project directory two directories "Debug" and
"Release" will hold .OBJ and .EXE Files.
<li>Button [Create]
<li>Menu [Insert] [Files into Project]. Insert first the main program for exemple
C:\HOME\CC\UTIL\ALL.CPP.Try to Translate. Then add the required subroutines.
from subdirectory C:\HOME\CC\LQ .</ol>

This procedure in opposite to the usage of a precompiled library has
<ul>
<li>Advantages :
<ul>
<li>Subroutines may be debugged directly with the main program</ul>

<li>Disadvantages :
<ul>
<li>Compilation time for the whole project is longer.
<li>for each main program all .obj files will be saved in separate subdirectories.
Needs more disk space.</ul>
</ul>
