  <h1>AVR Software Framework (ASF) - A new user's perspective from the command line</h1>
  <p class="byline">by Bruce Fletcher, September 2011</p>

  <p>This is a review of the AVR Software Framework (ASF) for the
  <a href="http://www.avrfreaks.net/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=945">contest</a>
  Atmel recently began running on <a href="http://www.avrfreaks.net">AVR Freaks</a>.
  I am examining the viability and utility of ASF for command line development in a UNIX
  environment, specifically Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion), and I primarily address AVR XMEGA development.
  Also, I am writing toward someone like myself who considers themselves to be proficient at programming
  but who may be new to ASF and AVR development in general, so it includes details that are perhaps
  obvious to experienced AVR developers but that new users may appreciate.</p>
  
  <h2>Distribution and licensing</h2>  
  <p>ASF can be downloaded from <a href="http://asf.atmel.com/">asf.atmel.com</a>, and the download
  <a href="http://www.avrfreaks.net/index.php?name=PNphpBB2&file=viewtopic&p=861047#861047">ostensibly requires registration</a>
   but does not require agreeing to any EULA.  There are third party components with their own licenses,
   but the Atmel code appears to all be covered (through the documentation header in each source code file)
   by what looks to me like <a href="license.txt">a fairly typical MIT/BSD-type license</a> with one
   interesting additional clause:</p>

  <pre>
  4. This software may only be redistributed and used in connection with an
  Atmel AVR product.
  </pre>

  <p>I find that all to be acceptable, but I think Atmel is missing an opportunity here.
  I will argue for changes to ASF's distribution and licensing after playing with the
  code itself.
  </p>
  

  <h2>ASF - What is it?</h2>
  <p>I think the first thing you need to understand about the ASF is that it
  is not a framework as you might be used to if you have a background with Microsoft's
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Foundation_Class_Library">MFC</a> or
  Apple's <a href="http://developer.apple.com/technologies/mac/cocoa.html">Cocoa</a>.
  Rather, it is mostly a relatively loose collection of drivers, services, utilities and examples for working with the
  specific hardware features of a range of Atmel's
  <a href="http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/devices.asp?category_id=163&family_id=607&subfamily_id=2138">AVR32</a>,
  <a href="http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/devices.asp?category_id=163&family_id=607&subfamily_id=760">megaAVR</a>
  and <a href="http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/devices.asp?category_id=163&family_id=607&subfamily_id=1965">AVR XMEGA</a>
  MCUs.  Since these processors have widely divergent capabilities and limited memory resources,
  a single cohesive framework wouldn't make much sense.</p>

  <p>So then what exactly does ASF contain?  The
  <a href="http://atmel.com/dyn/products/tools_card.asp?tool_id=4192&category_id=163&family_id=607&subfamily_id=2138">current
  stand-alone download</a> (version 2.6.1 as of this writing) unpacks to a whopping 270MB on disk,
  including 3889 directories and 9210 files.  That's pretty intimidating at first blush, but it
  becomes more manageable if you make a little effort to break things down and understand the
  underlying structure.</p>

  <p>At the top level, there are 5 directories like so:</p>
  <pre>
  avr32/        - code specific to AVR32 &mu;Cs
  common/       - code common to multiple architectures
  mega/         - code specific to megaAVR &mu;Cs
  thirdparty/   - third party code for multiple architectures
  xmega/        - code specific to AVR XMEGA &mu;Cs
  </pre>

  <p>The third party code is broken down by project, but the other folders tend to be organized like so:</p>

  <pre>
  applications/ - example applications using drivers etc.
  components/   - interfaces for various hardware components
  drivers/      - drivers for various hardware components
  services/     - non-driver software libraries
  boards/       - definitions of Atmel's various development boards
  utils/        - build scripts & related files
  </pre>

  <p>More details on the above are available in the <a href="readme.txt">readme.txt</a> file included at the
  root of the distribution.</p>
  
  <p>Fortunately, the various types of folders in the above list tend to be regularly organized.
  If you drill down into a specific
  driver directory for example, you will commonly see files laid out like this:</p>

  <pre>
  drivers/
    gpio/
      doxygen/  - documentation
      gpio.c    - the actual driver code is here
      gpio.h    - ... and here
      local_bus_example/
        gpio_local_bus_example.c    - an example of using this driver
        at32uc3l064_stk600-rcuc3l0/ - and some board-specific build directories
          doxygen/
          gcc/
          iar/
        at32uc3l064_uc3l_ek/
        (other boards...)
      peripheral_bus_example/
      simulator_example/
  </pre>

  <p>Each driver will have its code and doxygen documentation folder in the specific
  driver's root folder, for instance, along with clearly marked example sub-folders which again all
  have similar layouts.  Once you recognize the pattern, navigating the code base is quick and
  efficient.</p>
  
  <p>Using avr-gcc on the command line, the place to actually build any of these examples
  is in those gcc directories, and you can ignore the iar ones.  Of course you generally don't want
  to start doing your development in the ASF directory tree, and I will discuss more about that later.</p>

  <p>With all of this structure in mind,
  we can now begin to find meaning in otherwise mind numbing file and folder counts:</p>

  <div class="inset">
  <h3>Table 1: Folder counts in ASF directories</h3>
  <table>
  <thead>
    <td>subtree</td>
    <td></td>
    <td>total</td>
    <td></td>
    <td>gcc builds</td>
    <td>iar builds</td>
    <td></td>
    <td>drivers</td>
    <td>components</td>
    <td>services</td>
    <td></td>
    <td>examples</td>
  </thead>
  <tr>
    <td>avr32/</td><td></td><td>2264</td><td></td><td>388</td><td>379</td><td></td><td>43</td><td>8</td><td>8</td><td></td><td>91</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>common/</td><td></td><td>822</td><td></td><td>132</td><td>113</td><td></td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>15</td><td></td><td>26</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>mega/</td><td></td><td>204</td><td></td><td>61</td><td>0</td><td></td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td></td><td>9</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>xmega/</td><td></td><td>293</td><td></td><td>43</td><td>41</td><td></td><td>20</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td></td><td>27</td>
  </tr>
  </table>
  </div>

  <p>You can draw your own conclusions from the above table, but personally I think I might be more likely to
  rely on ASF for XMEGA or AVR32 development than for megaAVR projects.</p>

  <p>At any rate, I feel like Atmel should be making an effort to provide overview information like this
  rather than leaving it to potential ASF users to muck around figuring it out by themselves.</p>

  <h2>Documentation</h2>

  <p>Atmel is keen to point out that ASF code is extensively documented via <a href="http://www.doxygen.org/">Doxygen</a>
  code comments, and it is true that this is better than some API documentation I've seen.
  Generally, though, I find myself relying on the code
  directly rather than any Doxygen output for a few reasons.  There is no comprehensive indexing of the
  documentation, so if you want to switch from GPIO to ADC documentation, for example, you have to hunt down
  (and possibly generate) the appropriate index.html file yourself.  Also, I find there are often things
  like #define constants I want
  to look at more closely that aren't always linked in the documentation.  And finally, the code tends to
  be well enough and consistently enough written that I just
  don't find I need to refer to anything else.  Good IDEs are definitely nice to have for quickly navigating
  through source code, but using grep is
  a pretty painless experience if you create scripts to drive searches like this:</p>

  <pre>
  ella:asf $ time grep -R "define IOPORT_CREATE_PIN" .
  ./xmega/drivers/ioport/ioport.h:#define IOPORT_CREATE_PIN(port, pin) ((PORT_##port) + (pin))

  real  0m0.730s
  user  0m0.362s
  sys   0m0.365s
  ella:asf $ _
  </pre>

  <p>What Atmel doesn't say about the ASF is that
  <a href="http://www.avrfreaks.net/index.php?name=PNphpBB2&file=viewtopic&p=867798#867798">you'll want to
  also read through their Application Notes</a> before you go in too deep, at least for the XMEGA.  I can
  attest that some of them are highly relevant to XMEGA ASF development.  I think there should be prominent
  links to them in the documentation, but if there is even a single mention of App Notes in the ASF download
  I've been unsuccessful at finding it.</p>

  <h2>Using ASF for AVR XMEGA development</h2>

  <p>Now that we know what we actually have in the ASF, it's time to try some development.
  I'm working with quite a 
  <a href="http://www.mikroe.com/eng/products/view/580/mikroxmega-board/">nice little board from MikroElektronika</a>,
  and therefore I'll be targeting the ATxmega128A1 with external peripherals of my choice on a breadboard.</p>

  <h3>Project 1: Out-of-tree development</h3>
  <p>If the ASF is going to be at all useful to me, I want to be able to do all my development outside
  of the ASF folder tree so I can easily swap in a new version when it is released.  My preferred
  directory structure would be something like this:</p>

  <pre>
  $HOME/Projects/
    asf -> asf-2.6.1
    asf-2.6.1/
    x128/
      project1/
      project2/
      ...
  </pre>

  <p>The 'asf' entry is a symbolic link, so I can swap out ASF versions at will.  So the first question
  is, can I make this work?  Lets just try to build an existing, untouched example in-tree and out-of-tree
  and see how much work is required.</p>

  <p>I'll start with a simple example, the XMEGA Analog Comparator driver on the
  <a href="http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/tools_card.asp?tool_id=17168&category_id=163&family_id=607&subfamily_id=1965">XMEGA-A1 Xplained</a> board.
  To begin, create a project folder in your own tree and copy the following files from the 
  <span class="mono">asf/xmega/drivers/ac/example</span> folder:</p>
  
  <pre>
  atxmega128a1_xplain/gcc/Makefile   =>    Makefile
  atxmega128a1_xplain/gcc/config.mk  =>    config.mk
  ac_example.c                       =>    ac_example.c
  </pre>

  <p>Now make the following changes:</p>

  <ol>
  <li>In the Makefile, change the include path
  <pre>
  from: <span class="mono">../../../../../../common/utils/make/Makefile.avr.in</span>
  to:   <span class="mono">../../asf/common/utils/make/Makefile.avr.in</span>
  </pre></li>
  <li>In config.mk, change <span class="mono">PRJ_PATH</span> to <span class="mono">../../asf</span>, and remove the
  path information before <span class="mono">ac_example.c</span>.
  </li>
  </ol>

  <p>That's it, there is no step 3!  A handful of tweaks to two build files was all it took.  You can now run
  <span class="mono">make</span> in the ASF's gcc folder and in your own separate
  new project folder and you will generate identical .hex files to download to your AVR.  I found that to
  be surprising and quite encouraging, so now lets try building something new.</p>

  <h3>Project 2: "Hello, world" on a new board</h3>

  <p>Let's face it, very few projects are going to live their lives on something like an Xplained board.
  You have to be able to build your own board and still easily use an untouched ASF tree or ASF just isn't
  that useful.  So the goal of this project is the "hello world" of MCU projects, the blinky light.</p>

  <p>The first step is to grab a suitable example to build from.  I picked the XMEGA RTC driver
  as my base for this project so I could see how to set up RTC driver as quickly as possible.  Don't
  forget to perform the same build customizations as in project 1 above.</p>

  <p>The next step is to define the board.  A board definition is an include file that provides #define
  statements saying what external peripherals you have hooked to what pins etc., and also a .c file that
  will initialize the board after a reset.
  At the bottom of <a href="project2_blinky/config.mk.txt">config.mk</a>
  is a board reference like <span class="mono">CPP_FLAGS = -D BOARD=(foo)</span>.  The actual board name
  depends on what build dir you copy your code from, but it doesn't matter what it is.  If you change it
  to <span class="mono">USER_BOARD</span>, ASF will look for a header called
  <span class="mono"><a href="project2_blinky/user_board.h.txt">user_board.h</a></span>.
  I put my initialization code in
  <span class="mono"><a href="project2_blinky/user_board.c.txt">user_board.c</a></span> for consistency.
  You'll need to add "<span class="mono">CFLAGS = -I .</span>" to have the compiler find your user_board.h
  file in your project directory.</p>
  
  <p>Finally, code up your <a href="project2_blinky/blinky.c.txt">main file</a>, include it in config.mk
  in place of the original example.c file
  and you're done!  Compile, download and enjoy the hypnotic 0.5 Hz blinks.  Unless you're
  an experienced AVR developer with your own well developed code fragments and project templates, I
  really can't imagine a faster way of getting projects off the ground.</p>

  <h3>Project 3: not *quite* ready yet...</h3>

  <h2>Conclusions and recommendations</h2>
  <h3>General comments</h3>

  <p>My first impression of ASF was that it was too difficult to get, too large and unwieldy to use, and only had
  disorganized documentation of the most trivial kind; the "function frooze_bizzle() froozes the bizzle -
  any questions?" variety.  Some of my initial criticisms still stand; Atmel does need to get someone
  to provide more comprehensive introductory and overview documentation, for example, and they really need
  to include references to relevant Application Notes into the Doxygen content, but the API documentation
  is decent for what it is intended to cover.</p>

  <p>More importantly the code itself is very useful, and the build tools and general structure look like
  they were designed for the command line first, which is surprising and impressive with Atmel focusing so
  much energy on AVR Studio 5.  At this point, I can't imagine developing anything for the XMEGA without
  using ASF, and I absolutely did not expect to reach that conclusion when I first downloaded it.</p>

  <p>As I mentioned earlier, highly experienced greybeard AVR developers probably have all the battle
  tested code they need to target XMEGAs, so I expect that they're less likely to lead the charge
  on adopting ASF.  For hobbyists and educational users, the kind of people who will be designing and
  developing the microcontroller-based products of the future, ASF appears to encapsulate a large amount
  of important datasheet detail and best practices - helping us to get useful results quickly
  and thereby encouraging further exploration and use of AVR hardware.  The ASF looks to me like a
  strategic asset that Atmel should exploit to the fullest.  Which leads us back at the end to where
  we started...</p>

  <h3>Distribution and licensing</h3>

  <p>I have argued above that ASF provides a significant value-add to Atmel's AVR products for
  important classes of users.
  The problem is that these users are increasingly conditioned to expect instant online access
  to any sort of 'free' code, and I believe there's a perception that free
  code that is locked away is probably not something its developers are very proud of.  If you're
  not proud of your own code enough to really get it out there,
  why should your average user make the effort to "dig it out of the trash?"</p>
  
  <p>A related issue is that many educational and hobby
  users are concerned with free or open source licensing terms, so using code that is only
  licensed for use "in connection with an Atmel AVR product" will almost certainly cause some amount
  of negative heat and light in 'PIC vs AVR' debates and the like, and should be changed if possible.
  </p>
  
  <p>Atmel has an
  <a href="http://dangerousprototypes.com/2011/08/30/editorial-our-friend-microchip-and-open-source/">enviable
  position</a> with open source hardware enthusiasts, (seriously, read through the comments on that blog post)
  largely thanks to its free and libre
  development tools and things like Arduino that have gravitated to the AVR architecture
  <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Introduction">as a result of this freedom</a>.
  I think this gives Atmel a competitive advantage with educational users and hobbyists,
  and since these people expand the pool of pre-trained AVR developers it should in
  the long run increase Atmel's number of AVR design wins down the road.</p>

  <p>So how can Atmel maximize the impact of ASF?  I would recommend two things: put it up on
  <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>, for starters, which would make the code available
  with minimal friction to a wide base of users.  Secondly I would recommend that Atmel consider
  dual-licensing the ASF with its current commercial-friendly license and the GPL.</p>
  
  <p><a href="http://lwn.net/2001/features/LarryWall/">Larry Wall dual-licensed Perl</a> for
  similar reasons; the GPL made the code more acceptable in non-commercial circles, and the
  Artistic license made Perl more palatable to commercial users.  The difference in this case
  is the addition of 'clause 4' of the current license, which should give the more nervous
  decision makers in Atmel the assurance that competitors aren't going to just walk in and
  port the ASF to other platforms, effectively free riding on Atmel's expensive software
  development work.</p>

  <p>Overall, I'm glad I dug into the ASF, and I look forward to using it more extensively in the near
  future.  Thanks for reading, and I hope you found something here worth your while.</p>
