# [ASF review] A new user's view

## Summary

I am examining the viability and utility of ASF for command line development in a UNIX environment, specifically Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion), and I primarily address AVR XMEGA development. Also, I am writing toward someone like myself who considers themselves to be proficient at programming but who may be new to ASF and AVR development in general, so it includes details that are perhaps obvious to experienced AVR developers but that new users may appreciate.
