## Summary

The USBTInyMkII is an avr programmer that uses the LUFA firmware to emulate an Atmel AVRISP-MkII. It supports the programming of the entire 8-bit AVR range via ISP as well as the PDI (for the newer XMEGA AVRs) and TPI (for the 6-pin TINY AVRs).  

Features include upgradeable firmware which can be configured for hardware or software emulation and switch selectable USB or target supplied power.
