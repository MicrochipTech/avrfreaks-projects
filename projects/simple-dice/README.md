## Summary

This is a very small and simple electronic dice. It's the first AVR program I've written, so it should be very well suited to get started programming AVRs. The code is very compact and easy to understand as almost every line is commented. It is written for the AT90S1200, and only requires a minimum of hardware. Seven LEDs with appropriate resistors, a momentary switch and any clock source (i.e. ceramic resonator) will do.
