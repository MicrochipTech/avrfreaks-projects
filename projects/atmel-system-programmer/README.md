## Summary

The atisp software is a parallel port based in system programmer on GNU/Linux environment for Atmel's microcontrollers AT89S8252/AT89S8253 and ATtyny2313 (avr series), providing the usual read/write/verify/erase deviceÂ´s flash/eeprom memories features. This software gives very complete AT89S8253 support,including full page mode read/write Flash/Eeprom access, which is not a device commonly supported on similar GNU/Linux tools. Furthermore, it can understand as31 free assembler byte format in addition to standard Intel Hex file format. It's simple and little because uses only a three wires interface cable and don't support others programming kits. The expansion to other devices should be simple, including other Atmel's avr microcontrollers too. This software requires GNU dependencies only. Finally, the programmer is currently in a functionality stage (fully operable).
