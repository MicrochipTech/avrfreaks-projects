## Summary

This library allows you to take in whatever data you want with your AVR in order to create controller signals for the Playstation 2. In your code, you simply create an instance of the provided dataForController\_t type, then pass that data into the sendPS2Data function, and the code takes care of the nitty-gritty details.


The Google Code repository has the most up-to-date version of the code, so it's best to go there:
