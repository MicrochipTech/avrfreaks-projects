## Summary

Bar Code scanner software using PS/2 keyboard interface. Operational with CueCat low cost scanner (EBay) but should work with any PS/2 keyboard wedge scanner. Two versions supplied - one for straight unencrypted ASCII data, the other decodes CueCat encrypted data. Written using GCC 3.2, based on ATMEGA163. Complete with article, photos and complete c code for both versions. The CueCat is an interesting story on its own - another underground cult(try <http://airsoldier.com/~cuecat>). This project builds on the PS/2 keyboard in article #100. [don@botgoodies.com](mailto:don@botgoodies.com), [www.botgoodies.com](http://www.botgoodies.com).
