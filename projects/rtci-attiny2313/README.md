# RTCI-ATTiny2313

Uploaded by gogamoga on 2011-11-20 23:32:00 (rating 0 out of 5)

## Summary

This include file is a set of macros which are good for 2 purposes:


1. Enable runtime changeable interrupts functionality  

2. Simplify definition of interrupt entry points (if RTCI is not needed)


Documentation is inside the .inc file.  

For models other than ATTiny2313 it probably will not work.
