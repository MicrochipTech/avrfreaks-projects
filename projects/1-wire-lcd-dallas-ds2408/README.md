## Summary

The ATTiny25/45/85-Series have enought power for even more complex applications.The only drawback is the limited amount of I/O-Pins.To overcome this problem i developed this Code which drives a Standard HD44780 compatible LCD over a 1-Wire Bus.  

Thanks to Peter Dannegger for his great 1-Wire Code, which i have included.With some small modifications this code should fit to all AVRÂ´s with SRAM.  

Added modified 1wire\_11MHz.inc.Please replace the original File with this one.
