## Summary

I always wanted to work with robotics. I just dont know where to start. One day I find about this robot. It is pretty familiar to all. So I dont want to make you bore by explaining all the thing.


In case you donâ€™t know what is LINE FOLLOWING ROBOT is, itâ€™s a robot that can follow a line automatically. The line should be darker on lighter floor or vice versa. Like black line on white floor.


I also add an extra feature that it can avoid any obstacle in its path.


I use ATtiny26 microcontroller as my robots brain. The robot can detect the line by Infrared Sensor. I use five sensors.
