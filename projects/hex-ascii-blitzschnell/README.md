## Summary

Hi Freaks.


1 Microsecond or less!


 Using an overclocked Mega168 @24Mhz it's possible to convert a Hex 


byte value lying between 0 and 255 to 3 Ascii Characters and to elimate 


all leading zeros as well.

Ps. I wrote this mini codelet just for fun. More serious stuff for the 


AVR can be found here ... <http://www.ullasmann.eu>
