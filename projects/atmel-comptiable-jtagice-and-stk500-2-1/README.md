## Summary

The product use a jtag-ice and stk500 two in one,So you can not only emulate a AVR chip with jtag but aslo write all of AVR chips by stk500 with it.we use a mega16 to work for jtag\_ice and a mega8535 for stk500. so the two device use atmel offical firmware, it hadn`t compatible question, The mega16 work for jtag\_ice and to upgarde itself and mega8535. we had used the BOOT code for it. The communication part use a USB-Bridge chip to simulator a virtual com in PC,So you can use AVR Studio develop software to communication with it.a one advanced method is it can be upgraded by itself, so you can upgrade the firmware as soon as you need, you can upgrade it or degrade it.Another advanced method is it use usb port to communication with a PC, so the speed is more faster than a serial port.
