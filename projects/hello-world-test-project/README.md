# Hello World Test Project

## Summary

Took about 15 minutes to google, locate, download, install, write, build, simulate, debug, trace, and modify, and trace some more my first AVR program. Guess I'm going to have to order a programmer and some AVR parts now. 


Note that this project is probably not worth downloading unless you want to see a simple 'hello world' c program. As soon as I receive my AVR Dragon programmer I'll post details of a real hardware project involving a rotary encoder and a stepper motor. The objective of these first AVR projects is to help me decide if I should switch from PICs to AVR's for most of my simple MCU projects.
