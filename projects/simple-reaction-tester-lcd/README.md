## Summary

This is my first project with my new STK500 and a ATmega32 :)  

It's a simple reaction tester with record function.  

I have a 2x16 LCD at PORTA. 


You must push a button few seconds later a LED will light.  

If the LED begins to light you must push another button as  

fast as you can.


Then the reaction time will shown on the Display.  

The fastest time will be stored in the internal EEPROM  

and will be shown when ever you startet the "game".


Have a lot of fun!
