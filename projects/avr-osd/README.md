# AVR-OSD

Uploaded by rblake on 2003-02-25 16:10:00 (rating 0 out of 5)

## Summary

Simple demonstration of overlaying AVR generated video on top of live NTSC video.  

Displays data received over serial port in 32 character format (by 20 lines).  

Could use custom font set to create graphic images, or modify the code to simply display a  

bitmap stored in RAM/Flash rather than text.


Now updated with the font file.
