What's in this package</a></h3>
This program consists of five smaller projects put together in a single project. The first project is the NeoRS232-protocol. This is an idle-RQ stop and wait protocol with a CRC16-checksum. The second and following project all have more or less to do with cryptograpy. The second project is an implementation of a hardware number generator. Secure hardware numbers are very important in cryptography for generating keys and authentication. The third project is the SHA-1 hash calculation algorithm. This has been implemented in assembly language. The fourth project, the HMAC calculation makes use of the SHA-1 calculation to sign messages for authentication purposes. The fifth project, namely the Kryptoknight authentication algorithm combines all of the above projects in a process that enables two machines to authenticate one another. <h3><a class="anchor" name="why">
Why did I make this project?</a></h3>
The main incentive to start this project was to improve security in wireless systems for garagedoors. People lock there houses with sophisticated mechanical keys, but leave their garagedoor nearly unprotected. Current wireless garagedoor systems are actually very simple and easy to hack when one has a sender and a transmitter. <hr size="1"><address style="align: right;"><small>Generated on Wed Jun 1 20:52:32 2005 for AVR-Kryptoknight by&nbsp;
