&nbsp;&nbsp; With new, well optimized 
<a href="/ATMEL/MODplayer3/MODplayer3_eng.html">MOD-player 3</a> 
it is possible to play multichannel trackers at reasonable sampling rates however there is one small problem. 
There are almost no multichannel trackers in ProTracker format (MOD). Conversion of S3M into MOD is very complicated 
and not always possible so I've decided to implement S3M loader for my player. ScreamTracker 3 is very similar to ProTracker 
so it wasn't to complicated but it has several problems. First one is that S3M uses unsigned samples while 
MOD uses signed. Coversion in realtime needs several more clock cycles in mix loop (some XOR and decision whether signed/unsigned) so 
this seems to be a bad solution. Preconversion to signed whould take at least 1s/1MB at 20MHz and I can't stand 
devices that hes response time longer than some 100ms so this is also wrong solution for me. :-) 
Therefore there left only last possibility: To make some program for PC that will preconvert S3M sample format. Since 
I had to make it this way it also converts S3M header into something between MOD and S3M. Resulting format is simple 
as MOD but has all advantages of S3M like compressed patterns, default panning, volume commands, etc.

&nbsp;&nbsp; It's almos identical to previous 
<a href="/ATMEL/MODplayer3/MODplayer3_eng.html">MOD-player 3</a>. 
Only difference is that I had to make digital stereo mix instead of analog (because of panning effect) so 
I've removed mixing resistors from OPAMP outputs.

 </tr>
</table><br>

<p align="justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp; Core of this player is relatively powerfull MCU AVR ATmega644-PU at <i>20MHz</i>. 
It has <i>64kiB</i> of FLASH and <i>4kiB</i> of RAM which is quite enough for all structures and some audio FIFO. 
External SRAM is addressed in SW mode using two address buffers IC2 and IC3. It's using only two ports and 
few control signals. SRAM should be at least <i>55ns</i> version. 
Same ports are shared with IDE interface in 16-bit mode, with HD44780 LCD in 8-bit mode and with buttons interface.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Audio output is same as in last version with I<sup>2</sup>S-like serial DAC connected at SPI interface. 
More information how to handle it with AVR can be found 
<a href="/ATMEL/necoteorie/tutorial/AudioTest/I2Semulation/I2S_emulation.html">here</a> 
(but only in czech right now).<br> 
</p>

<div class="n3">2.1 Overclocking</div><p align="justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp; Used MCU should work at least at <i>20MHz</i> but while experimenting with mutlichannel trackers 
I've tried to push it up a bit. At first only for <i>24MHz</i> but since it seemed to work I've tried <i>27MHz</i> 
and still no problem. This is quite interesting because my old ATmega32 had problems even at <i>18MHz</i> 
(code worked only if it was aligned from even address :D). Because I haven't found any faster crystal I've 
tried to use some <i>32MHz</i> oscillator from table sediments and after few aditional wait cycles for SRAM 
and IDE interface it works with no problems! It actually worked at <i>40MHz</i> @ <i>6V1</i> but that was 
a bit much for other components. ;-) 
</p>


<div class="n2">3. Software</div><p align="justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp; Code it written in pure ASM but this time I've used louds of macros and I've 
tried to make comments everywhere. I've also split the code from 7k+ lines long "noodle" into 
several modules so it should be easier to undestand it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Song can be loaded via serial interface without flow control of from FAT16 
formated HDD or CF card with one level of folders (short file names only supported). 
Only first 255 folders and 255 files from each folder can be selected but 
I think it's more than enough.<br>
<a href="fw/S3Mplay_TDA1543.zip" target="blank">Source and binary for TDA1543</a>, 
<a href="fw/S3Mplay_TDA1545.zip" target="blank">source and binary for TDA1545</a>.
</p>


<div class="n3">3.1 Control</div><p align="justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp; At first external SRAM is tested. If there is at least <i>64kiB</i> program should continue. 
If no SRAM is found or there is error detected program should stop. 
Next step is detection of IDE device. If something is found and first partition is formated as FAT16 
player should enter into folder menu. 
If no IDE device is detected or IDE interface is disabled and player should enter into serial port loading mode. 
In this mode player waits for MOD data that can be send by any terminal without flow control 
(MCU is fast enough). End of file is detected automatically - file loading is finished if there 
is no recieved byte for more than <i>1.5sec</i>. Serial load can be also activated manually with "COM" button.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp Other button functions in different modes should be obvious from the scheme. 
</p>

<div class="n3">3.2 Options</div><p align="justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of usefull options are present at beggining of <i>"m644_modplay.asm"</i> module. 
Parameters are described in following table.<br><br>


<table border="1" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1">

 </tr>
</table><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; There are some more parameters in this module but it's usually not neccessary to change them. 
Only important parameter is audio FIFO size which should be always maximal (it should use entire unused RAM) but it can't be 
shorter than <i>1kiB</i> because it's shared with another module as data buffer (<i>"storage.asm"</i>).
</p>


<div class="n3">3.3 Fuse bits</div><p align="justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp; If player is used with crystal CKOPT fuse should be programmed (full swing oscilator amplitude). 
JTAG should be disabled because it's located at data pins which are therefore in weak-high level mode. This is 
a bit problematic for fast data transfers. Another solution could be use of external pull-ups but I've didn't 
tried that.
</p>


<div class="n2">4. Supported formats and effects</div><p align="justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp; Player should be able to play uncompressed ProTracker files (*.MOD) theoretically with 
any channel count but of course with adequate sampling rate.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; It is also able to play preconverted ScreamTracker 3 (S3M). For this conversion I've made simple program 
called "S3M_2_MD3_convertor". It should be able to open any S3M and if it has supported format it should write 
resulting file in my own format called ModTracker3 (MD3). Main covnersion utility is console application of course 
but I've made simple GUI for it that allows simple conversion of multiple files at once.<br><br>
