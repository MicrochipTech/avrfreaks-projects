## Summary

To reduce the size of the PCB to fit in the small place of  

the CD-ROM of a PC there is two tricks in the design


1-There is no base resistors for the Driving transistors.  

 Instead the pins connected to the transistors bases is  

 defined as input pins and the pull-up resistor is used  

 as a base resistor


2-In the schematic the collectors of the sink transistors  

 are connected to the ground but when the board is assembled  

 the collectors and the Emitters are reversed so the emitters  

 are grounded
