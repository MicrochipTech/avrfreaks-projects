Uploaded by haraldkipp on 2002-08-01 16:47:00 (rating 0 out of 5)

## Summary

This 8k byte boot loader contains everything  

to query a DHCP server for a boot image file  

and download this file from a TFTP server.  

In about 4 seconds your ATmega is ready to  

run the new application code.


Open Soure with BSD style licence.


Requires an ATmega 128 board with RTL8019AS  

Ethernet controller. The Ethernut reference design  

is available at  

[www.ethernut.de](http://www.ethernut.de)


Latest news: Unfortunately uisp uploads the hexfile  

to a wrong flash ROM location. Only AvrStudio with  

ATJTAPICE had been verified to work. Any advice  

would be welcome.
