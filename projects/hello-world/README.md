## Summary

I used AVR Design Note #043 manipulating strings routine. This program was written for my personal AVR study.  

Description :  

The program fetches the string "Hello World" in the program memory and send it to Hyperterminal screen via UART. To me, I have learned how to make use of the content Stack pointers pointing to the next location after the call instruction by writing and experimenting it. You can learn it from reading the design notes of it or stimulating and trying my sample program with STK500 board. I hopes it may be helpful to you.
