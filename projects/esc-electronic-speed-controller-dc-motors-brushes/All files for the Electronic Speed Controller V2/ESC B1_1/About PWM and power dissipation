The Electronic Speed Controller Program uses Pulse Width Mudulation (PWM) to
controll the speed of the DC motor. Here is how this works:
Immagine the battery power as a block wave with a frequency F. During a percentage
(the OnTime) of the period T (=1/F) of that block wave you apply the full battery
power to the motor and the rest of the period (the Off-time) you apply no battery
power at all to the motor. It can be proven that the speed of the motor is
proportional to the on-time of that PWM signal.

FINDING THE IDEAL PWM FREQUENCY

A) Minimum PWM-frequency needed to obtain good controll over the motor's speed ?

A DC motor contains a large coil (the windings). When you apply a voltage over a
coil the current though the coil will start increasing. When you stop supplying a
voltage over the coil the current trough the coil will start decreasing.
So what happens when we apply the battery power as a PWM signal to a DC motor ?
During the on-time the current through the motor will increase. During the rest of
the time the current though the motor will be decreasing.
If the frequency is high enough the current will be almost stable since the coil
does not get the time to let the current change a lot.
With the formula here below you can calculate the delta between the lowest current
and the highest current in a coil (dI%) for a coil with a Resistance (R) and an
Induction (L) when you apply a PWM-signal with a frequency Fpwm.

                                    -R/(2 * Fpwm * L)
                   dI% = 100 * (1 - e  )              

For a speed 900 motor with R = 0,03 Ohm and L = 100 µH this gives :

  dI    [%]      10%    9%    8%    7%    6%    5%    4%    3%    2%     1%
  Fpwm [Hz]    1423  1890  1798  2067  2067  2924  3674  4924  7423  15000

You can obtain good controll over the motor's speed when using Fpwm > 7 kHz.

B) The influence of PWM-frequency on the power discipation in the FET's ?

The power dissipation in a FET can be calculated with : Pd = U * I = R * I^2

When the FET is not conducting the power dissipation is 0 (because I=0).

When the FET is conducting it's resistance is Rds-on (0.004 for a IFR1404 FET)
and with I=40A the power dissipation in the FET will be 0.004 * 40^2 = 6.4 W.

When the FET is switching between on and off Pd = U/2 * I/2 = 12 * 20 = 240 W.
However the time that the FET is switching is very short. During 1 period of a PWM-
signal the FET will switch twice (on->off and off->on) and switching takes about
2,5 µs in a well designed ESC when using good H-bridge FET drivers.

The power dissipation caused by switching is :

           Pd switching = U/2 * I/2 * 2 * 2.5 * 10^-6 * Fpwm

For U=24V and I=40A the result as a function of Fpwm is:

  Fpwm [kHz]        3  5  8  10  13  15  18  20  23  25  28  30  33
  Pd switching [W]  4  6  9  12  15  18  21  24  27  30  33  36  39

The lower the PWM-frequency the less power needs to be dissipated in the FET's.

With Fpwm=7 kHz the power dissipation in the FET's will be 6.4 + 7 W = 13.4 W.
With FPwm=3 kHz the power dissipation in the FET's will be 6.4 + 4 W = 10.4 W

A well cooled IRF 1404 FET can handle about 25 W (P= dT/Rja).

From the above formulas

Ptotal = Rds-on * I^2 + U/2 * I/2 * 2.5 X 10^-6 * Fpwm = 25

What is  Imax for Fpwm = 3 kHz and U = 24V... It's 68A !

So a well de signed ESC using this program with IRF1404 FET's, a good FET driver
and correct FET-cooling should be able to deliver up to 68A continuous @ 24V.
