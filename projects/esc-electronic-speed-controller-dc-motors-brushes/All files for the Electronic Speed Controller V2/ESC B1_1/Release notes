************************************************************************************
Electronic Speed Controller Program Version Beta 1.0                   RELEASE NOTES
************************************************************************************

1)Addapted to more standard RC-set's
It turned out that for most RC-sets the receiver does not generate a 1 to 2 ms pulse
but actually more frequently they deliver a 1.1 to 1.9 ms pulse. This version of the
program expects 1.1 to 1.9 ms pulses from the RC receiver.

2)Larger ZERO means ZERO band
It turned out that you need a super stable transmitter to keep the neutral position
sufficiently well in place to realy stop the motor from making any movement. This
version has a ZERO band that is double the size it was in the Alpha 1.0 version.

3)Larger FULL-POWER-ZONE
It turned out that you need a super stable transmitter to make sure that full speed
on the transmitter translated indeed in full speed of the motor. In competition this
obviously is very important so I have now doubled the FULL-SPEED-ZONE.

4)Safer Failsave
The Failsave algorithm used in the Alpha 1.0 release was based on testing the
quality of the incoming pulses. No pulse would let the controller take the last
received pulse as the measure for the output signal. The result was that if the
controller was disconnected from the receiver the controller would continue to 
output some power. Unacceptable for a failsave. In this release we also switch to
failsave when we do not get a pulse for more then 20 ms.

OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT:
1)Current limiting capabilities
