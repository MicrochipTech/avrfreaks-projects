I would find it motivating to find out that people use my code.
I'm always interested to hear of things I can improve in my code.
***********************************************************************************

This program is intended for and has been used in DC motor speed controllers for
classic DC motors with brushes. Such circuits are also known as ESC or Electronic
Speed Controllers.

The program measures an input pulse that is supposed to come from a standard RC-
receiver and generates the four PWM signals needed to controll an H-bridge driver.

An ESC build around an AVR microcontroller loaded with this progam will bring :

  1) Forward AND Backward speed control using a full FET H-bridge (no relais)
  The less expensive commercial ESC's only deliver forward speed control.
  A lot of the commercial ESC's that can switch from forward to backward use
  relais. Relays make the swith-over slower and are for large currents (>10A)
  pretty big devices.

   2) Regenerative Breacking
  When we reduce the speed the energy that comes from the motor is restored to the
  battery. That helps consuming less energy of course but even more important
  is probably that it reduces the heating of the FET's on the ESP.

  3) >18 KHz Pulse With Modulation frequency
  Above the frequency that people can hear thus avoiding iritating noice from the
  motor and relatively low avoiding strong heating of the FET's during switching.

  4) Failsave
  When the ESP receives no longer clean and regular pulses from the RC receiver
  the ESP will switch to "breack" until clean regular signals are available again.

  This program does not include current limiter capabilities.


Till today (12 March 2006) the program has only been used in my ESC that was
designed to be used in featherweight (12 kg) competition robots.
The specs for that controller are Uin 14.5 to 24V, Iout 0 to 40 A (continuous).
It is using an Atmel ATtiny 13.
You can find a lot more information about that controlller here :

Look for DC Motor Controller.
