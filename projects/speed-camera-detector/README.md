# Speed camera detector

## Summary

The swedish road administration are really into speed cameras right now. I have not found any information about how to integrate speed cameras into the Saab infotainment system. So, my idea (and challenge) has been to build a device warning for speed cameras. I do not support speed driving but its easy to miss the speed limit signs when its dark - this device works as an extra reminder. 


Please have a look at my website for more information. The unit is now built-in my Saab 9-3 and has been working fine for two months.

Please comment or e-mail me if you have any questions.  

Thanks for a great website.

Mattias
