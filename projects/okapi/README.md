## Summary

Okapi is a safe and reliable Open Source (hard- and software) AVR programmer. It is run from the parallel port and it is fully buffered. Also, all signals are optically isolated so that errors in the target system will not damage your PC easily.


Read about it in [http://fruttenboel.verhoeven272....](http://fruttenboel.verhoeven272.nl/AVR/okapi.html)


Now: do you want to be a follower and use existing programmers and software? Or do you want to walk upfront and help refining this programmer?


At the moment there is no software at all. Only the hardware. So if you want to start work on something NEW this is your chance! No backward compatibillities to cater for. No corpses in closets that need to stay there, just for the sake of features long gone by now.


This is all new and you can put your name and fame here. This is a fun project. I will not race you, nor myself.


Regards,


Jan Verhoeven
