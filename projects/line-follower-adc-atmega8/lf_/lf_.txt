Hello there
Sorry, I don’t have any circuit diagram or sch prepared, but I am giving enough details for this
If you got it please prep a circuit diagram and mail it to me so as I can upload it on website.

Though LCD in circuit is not necessary but it will help you while debugging your hardware and programming and also while calibrating.
After completion of circuit don’t connect motors check voltage across motor connections using multi-meter because if there is any error in circuit your ics will be damaged

I hope you know about ir sensors, avr microcontroller and motor driving ics

The circuit details are here
Please consider following points
the type of this bot is 
                   rear wheel (driving whee)l are always running and steering is done by front wheels.


1.	Sensor 
-1 ir led for each sensor, voltage across led should not exceed 3V otherwise it will be damaged.
-sensors connected 5V in series with 10K resistance
-sensors should be connected in reverse
-sensor outputs taken from junction of resistance and –ve terminal of sensor	



2.	microcontroller connections as per atmega8 data sheet
a.	power – pin no 7, 20 and 21
-ground on pin no. 8 and 20

b.	clock 8 MHz
c.	sensor inputs 
S1 on adc0
S2 on adc1
S3 on adc2
And don’t forgot to connect pin no. 21 AREF to AVCC

d.	
3.	Motor driver circuit
L293d is used as motor driver
As per l293d datasheet connect
Input connections
	Pin no 1 (1,2EN), pin no. 16 (VCC1) and pin no. 9 (3,4EN) connected to 5v 
	Pin no 4, 5,13and 12 to ground
	Pin no 2(1A) to pin no 14 (PB0) of uc
	Pin no 7 (2A) to pin no 15(PB1) of uc
	Pin no 10 (3A) to pin no 9(PB6) of uc
	Pin no 15 to (4A) pin no 10 (PB7) of uc

Initially don’t connect vcc2 and check it is not shortened with any other pin. First verify and then connect vcc2 (it is voltage you want for motors) 
Motor connections
	1Y and 2Y for steering motor
	3Y and 4 Y for wheel driving motor
4.	LCD on portd as shown by cvavr code wizard.
