# Bathroom Electric Fan Timer

## Summary

I needed a timer to operate my bathroom fan and decided to build one my own to get some experience with the AVR micro controllers. The timer is started (and stopped) by pressing a push button. By default the fan will operate for one hour. An indication led gives some information about how long the fan will be turned on. The electric fan is switched on and off by using a solid-state relay (Sharp S202T02).


Future plan: to detect when the bathroom light is turn on and start the fan when the light is on for a certain period.
