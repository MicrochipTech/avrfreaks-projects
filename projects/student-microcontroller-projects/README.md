## Summary

Students in ECE 4760 at Cornell University were given the responsibility of choosing, designing and building a project using Atmel Mega644 microcontrollers. Projects this year include video object tracking, acoustic GPS navigator, and an automated rock band guitar player, as well as musical instruments and scientific devices.

During the last 5 weeks of the semester in ECE 4760, Microcontroller Design, students have to combine sensors, actuators, microcontrollers, and mathematical techniques to build something. All projects show a great deal of originality and work. There are over 350 projects on the page. This year the coding was done using WINAVR and AVRstudio.
