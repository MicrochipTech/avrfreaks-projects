Notes from the designer of Elmcie @ rev 5.1 schematics and rev 1.0 Software:

Schematic sheet 1 of 2:

1. The power for the relay is derived from the 9V supply. If you use a 5V-relais, R1 can be omitted and the 5V can be used instead.

2.Keep the lines between the LM311 inputs and the connector where you connect the DUT to, as short as possible. The same applies for the Large_C-line.

3. You may use a 78L05 (the small version) instead of the 7805, but bear in mind that it will get warm. You can reduce that by powering the relay form the 9V (as I did), and powering the backlight of the LCD from the 9V. Be carefull though .... 9V is deadly for the LCD and the AVR.

4. Read the notes in the schematic please :)

Schematic sheet 2 of 2:

5. If you write your own software, or adapt mine, consider to skip the backlight-boost (PortB.1). It's a battery powered device, and I found that one standard setting is sufficient. Doing so frees portB.1 . You can use it to control the LM311_power from a separate pin.

6. The ISP-pins are used for the LCD-data, and omitting the 4k7 resistors R36-38 will cause problem during ISP. Also note that R9 pulls the E-signal for the LCD low to prevent ISP-errors.

7. The quasi RS232 interface in the upper left corner can be omitted or replaced with a Max232 or alike. In case your LCD requires a negative bias-voltage, it's recommendable to do so.


Software rev 1.0:

8. The value of the calibration capacitors ( 2 pcs ) is stored in flash. You may want to change that.
But even if you write your own software, please read the ELMCIE1_0.rtf: there is quite some usefull information in the comments
