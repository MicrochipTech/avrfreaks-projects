## Summary

I am an AVR beginner and this file was written by me to educate myself in AVR.  

Initial idea was obtained from the <http://www.avrbeginners.net/>  

Please do refer to the site for more indept theroritical aspects.


This simple program convert an integer value in the register to the ASCII coded decimal. Since AVR doesnt have the divide instruction, the convertion is done manually.  

After the convertion is done, you can send these ASCII coded numbers to UART,USB, LCD interface, etc.  

I used AVR Studio 4.0 Simulator to see the register contents while writing this code.


Thanks:)
