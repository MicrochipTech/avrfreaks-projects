# Quadrature rotary decoder

## Summary

This was very interesting project with pulse error detection feature. Measuring two pulses should be relatively easy but it turns quite complex. Now I want to share it as I have done it my free time with no monetary benefit. 


All samples are written with CodeVisionAVR.


Documentation contains basic knowledge about quadrature sensors, different algorithms/routines with performance comparison, code samples and full code and PCB schematics. Optimized pulse detection algorithm with error detection also included. Please not that ASM optimized routines input pins are hardcoded and compiler redefinition does not apply.


Hope you like it.


Check the video below, it's quite intensive and takes only couple of minutes.
