## Summary

Within the framework of experiments on the human movements, the Scribens laboratory aims at replacing the use of digitizing tablets Wacom by computers' mice. With this intention, the acquisitions' performances of a computer's mouse must be characterized. Accordingly, a mouse simulator is under development. This last requires a space of storage for the simulation's data.


I have to integrate an external storage space (probably an EEPROM) that can stock at least 20 movements. Each movement can hold 2000 smaples (3 bytes each), wich will represent about 20 seconds of movement.
