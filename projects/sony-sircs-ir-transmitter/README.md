## Summary

Well, my sony-remote didn't really work well, so I made a transmitter so that I can use another remote (Philips) to control my Sony amplifier/reciver. It should be easy to implement in another project (since i publish appnotes instead of big projects). Timing is adapted for 4MHz.


Hardware is easy; just a 555, an ir-led and some standard discreet components.
