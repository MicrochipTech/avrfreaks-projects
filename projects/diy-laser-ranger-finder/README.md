## Summary

This project is a reverse engineering of the BOSCH DLE50 Laser Range Finder. The original firmware is replaced by this one, and then device is connected through UART interface to PC. Part of measurement process is controlled by user from PC, another part controlled by MCU (ATMega169P).


This project is not ready\_to\_use range finder, but the only interface to all required for distance measurements. As there are a lot possibilities in speed vs accuracy tradeoff, as well as in collateral MCU functions, a final developer is responsibly for right choose and final implementation.


Since 28/05/2011 standalone version is available as well. The project name is: AV Laser Range Finder
