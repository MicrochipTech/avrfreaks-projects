------------- Laser control -------------
Originally laser enabled by following combinations:
06 04, 10 00
06 24, 10 00
06 34, 10 00
06 34, 10 AB

laser intensity attenuated considerable on 
06 34, 10 66 (is it modulation)

On practice laser enabled by setting 
06 10, 10 A0
laser intensity attenuated considerable on 
06 10, 10 60 (is it modulation)

combination 16, 76 switch off laser regardles of mode (66 oe AB)
combination 16, F6 switch laser back to its mode (66 or AB)

------------- Power handling ------------

power switched ON by pressing POWER_ON or BIG_RED button. During power up sequence MCU have to 
set POWER_HOLD signal (active 1) in order to keep MCU powered after POWER_ON or BIG_RED buttons release.
POWER_HOLD active HIGH


------------- APD BIAS ------------
writing 06, 20 set APD BIAS CTRL to predefined level 0.626V
signal transition pattern as following:
3V spike ~2..4ms, then 100ms 0V, then 18ms linear rise from 0V to 0.6V 
??? how APD BIAS related with APD CTRL is there any feedback ???
??? Is APD BIAS CTRL used for BIAS LEVEL setup ???
Originaly APD BIAS rised 1 tick per 60usec, while 60usec is sampling period

------------- SIGNAL ------------
After APD BIAS setup received signal level degradate sligthly ~3% per 20sec in exponental form.
It migth be either laser or APD problem. Laser's parameters depend on numerous parameters and especialy on 
temperature.
