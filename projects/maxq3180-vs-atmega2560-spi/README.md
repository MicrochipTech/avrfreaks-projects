## Summary

SPI Comunications between IC Maxq3180 and Atmega2560 using AVRStudio4.0


Uses PORTB from Microcontroller in SPI mode operation to stablish connection to IC MAxq3180. I used AVRStudio 4.0 for programming the microcontrolor using JTAG interface or SPI mode programming.


This code below, shows how to perform a simple write and read on the MAxq3180 internal register.  

itÂ´s necessary a dysplay connected to microcontroller to see the process of Read/Write.
