## Summary

RTTTL ringtone player with just one ATtiny15L and speaker/buzzer


because of limited attiny15 flash size it can play kind of short tunes. however i tried to make the code as small as possible, though it can theoretically be made even smaller :)


no schematics, `cauze it's very simple:  

 just hook the attiny on the 3V battery, and drop a buzzer/small speaker on 4th io port, program it and it's playing!


by the way, you also need a 1-2kOhm resistor to Vcc on pin1, or you can toggle reset-on-poweron fuse.


Successefully used this one for a christmass card :)


PS. sorry, no comments in the code. i hope it is self-explanatory. however if somebody want, i will add some comments.
