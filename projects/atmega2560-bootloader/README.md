## Summary

When I search "atmega2560 boot-loader" on google, I cant find any result. So, I have decided to do this project as part of my job. In this project, - I use the X-modem protocol with some small modification and for each FLASH page (size 128 words) of this CPU, we need 2 packet (128 bytes/packet)  

- To run the bootloader program, the application on PC will assert the RTS pin of the RS232 port used to send .HEX file.  

- Now we've only finished the vietnamese version. But next time I will upload the english version.
