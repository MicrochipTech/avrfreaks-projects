## Summary

Description:  

The system generates 3 PWM outputs with differents patterns which can be selected sequentially by pressing SW1.  

Patterns are stored in flash and they can be created and modified easily.  

SW2 makes sequentially leds blink at different speeds. Also, if it is pressed for a while, the microcontroller goes to low power mode.  

SW1 wakes up the system if it is in low power.


Enjoy!
