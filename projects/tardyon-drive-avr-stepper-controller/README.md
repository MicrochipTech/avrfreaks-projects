# Tardyon Drive AVR Stepper Controller

Uploaded by Oxygenic on 2015-10-16 06:20:00 (rating 5 out of 5)

## Summary

This project provides an AVR-based, USB accessible, single-axis motion controller that can fit into an USB-connector completely and therefore is probably the worlds smallest stepper motor controller. Here both, hardware schematics and all software components are provided.


 


Features


* USB connection
* 28,5 kHz maximum step clock, ≈10 Hz minimum step clock
* fine speed and acceleration steps
* support of one single stepper motor via step and direction signals
* motion acceleration (speed ramps)
* freely definable referencing modes
* one digital input expecting TTL logical level for usage with reference switch or as trigger input
* easy to use programming inteface (API) for integration in own applications
* open hardware
