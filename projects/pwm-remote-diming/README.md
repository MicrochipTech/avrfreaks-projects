## Summary

The code is written using AVR STUDIO4 with WINAVR complier. The timer1 is enable in ATMEGA8 and PWM is taken out in OCR1A. The initial value is 10%. switch 1 is for ON and Switch 4 is for OFF. SW2 is Incrementing pwm, and Sw3 is decrementing pwm. The Hardware of Isolated LED driver is design using NXP design tool. The PWM is feed to the IC fo the LED driver and the output light is controlled easily. The dimmer circuit is along with this code.


The schematic is design using CADENCE16.3


The schematic of Flyback LED driver is given in Image file.
