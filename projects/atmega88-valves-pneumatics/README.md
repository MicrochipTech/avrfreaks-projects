## Summary

For my health, I wanted to keep my spine in motion during sleeping.  

I tried an alternating pressure mattress, but that caused problems for me.  

So I decided to make my own "Mattress with Motion".  

The hardware and software are as simple as possible.


On my webpage I explain how I tested the valves and pumps with a homemade flow meter and a pressure sensor.  

I made many photo's to explain how it's made, and I explain how I connect the valves and pumps.  

The ATmega88PA drives ULN2803A relay drivers, but instead of relays I use valves to control the air pressure.  

The air pressure is generated with aquarium pumps.


The hardware shows how to use an application with low pressure and low air flow.  

The code is an example how a sequence is made with 16 outputs.
