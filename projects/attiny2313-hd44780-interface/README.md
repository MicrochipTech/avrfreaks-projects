## Summary

For some reason a lot of code written to drive HD44780 LCDs from AVRs (usually ATMEGA8) didn't properly function on my ATTiny 2313. Although this may be to user error, I finally found code that I could tweak to work for my ATTiny 2313. I'm no expert, but I decided I'd post this to help anyone else who may be in a situation similar to mine. So, in broef, this is what I did:


I downloaded:

...from the author's site:

And I modified it as described here:
