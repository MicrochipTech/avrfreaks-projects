## Summary

This project is an entry to the 2007 Circuit Cellar / Stellaris contest, and won a "distinctive excellence" mention. It implements an algorithm for recycling binary tree nodes and subtrees (garbage collection and node allocation) which does not require tree traversal.


While the platform is for the Stellaris hardware required by the contest, the algorithm is encoded in (reasonably) portable C.
