## Summary

ADC conversion with 12 bit resolution, left ajustment, unity gain, in a free run mode and signed differential input mode. This circuit can be done with three serrially resistors. To measure a differential voltage, take the measuremnts across the middle resistor. Connect them into the pins A2 and A1. Be careful not to exceed the 3.3V. The program will read the voltage and saved it into the vin variable.
