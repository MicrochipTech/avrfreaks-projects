# Buzzbox - an audible Ohm meter

## Summary

BuzzBox is an audible Ohm meter used to check for wiring errors in a protoboard.


Design goals:  

1 - resolve between a good connection and a poor one  

2 - device must provide audible indication of connection quality  

3 - test voltage must not activate semiconductor junctions  

4 - test current must be no more than a few mA  

5 - device should be low power (it's <10mW idle, ~25mW max)


This project started as an idea taken from elm-chan.org, but his goal was to make a flea-powered device that never needed to be turned off. I wanted an accurate audible low-ohms meter.


This is an ideal project for a beginning builder/coder. There is some room for improvement. I intended to experiment with  

brownout detection, but it's good enough without it and I need to move on to other things. You can extend the range into the milliOhm region.
