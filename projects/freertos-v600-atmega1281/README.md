## Summary

// port of FreeRTOS v6.0.0 for the ATMega1281  

// Tested on a board and verified with a scope.  

// All it does is toggle a couple pins, though, so any other  

// stuff you're doing, you've got to figure out.  

//  

// Apologies for renaming the files, but for me, prefixing them  

// with "os\_" allows me to group them within my IDE. If you  

// rename them back you'll need to fix a couple of includes.
