## Summary

AVR MAD is a simple monitor and debugger program for the AVR micro. It works with any AVR Mega device which supports a serial interface and ~2.5K bytes (complete monitor) of memory available and a PC running a serial terminal program like Realterm or Hyperterminal. It is intended to be used as a simple startup debug-checkout program for new hardware verification while the real program is being designed.


The program consists of a monitor routine which calls a number of input data and display output routines. It allows a user to interact with a AVR device for debugging as well as parameter programming. Optionally, it can be started with a script call to run an automated debug or dump session. 


The monitor is designed to use as few resources as possible. The monitor is built from a set of independent routines. Rather than to implement dense optimized code, the approach is to keep the design as straight forward as possible so that it can be easily modified and extended as needed.
