## Summary

The Sony Unilink Controlled Wireless MP3Player, has been made due to a convenient problem, basically  

because each time i wanted to take some new music with me in my car, i needed to burn a CD with the songs  

I wanted to be able to listen to while driving.  

As the name says the Sony Unilink Controlled Wireless MP3Player (SUC), is first a interface to communicate  

with the Sony Auto Radio, and secondly has a wireless interface (802.11b) via the onboard CompactFlash slot.


With the SUC the MP3Player is from the Sony Radio seen as a CD changer, which it has full control over  

this means that the SONY Radio can send its command via the Sony Unilink Protocol to the SUC, fx. when the  

user presses 'NEXT', it is send to the SUC and the SUC again can send the infomation about the next song to the  

SONY Radio, so using the SONY Radio via the Unilink Control Protocol gives us a 'free' MMI (Man Machine Interface)  

which then again means that its not needed any extra keypad nor display in the car everything we need is the  

SONY Radio ;-)


Futhermore a server program has been made to support the SUC for file transfering and various house keeping,  

which can be perform on the SUC, at last to be named is that the SUC also has a TELNET server where some basic  

things can be handeld, primarily setup issues. 


The Sony Unilink Controlled MP3 Player consist of two hardware modules,  

one is based on the LPC2214 (ARM7), and one is based on the ATMega128 (AVR).


The homepage is just intended to be used for ideas, and inspirations.
