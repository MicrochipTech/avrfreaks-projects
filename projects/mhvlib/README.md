<http://www.makehackvoid.com/mhvlib>


An efficiency oriented runtime library for AVR microcontrollers, for those who feel restricted by the Arduino runtime.


Whats Implemented  

 * Digital I/O  

 * Timers  

 * Serial (both busy-waiting and asynchronous)  

 * External Interrupts  

 * Servo control  

 * Analogue to digital  

 * Hardware PWM  

 * Gamma correction - calculate on the fly, or lookup tables (recommended)  

 * Fast synchronous serial shifter (untested)  

 * Software H Bridge for driving naked transistors (with PWM support)  

 * Realtime Clock & event triggering  

 * Debouncing (detect button presses, as well as held buttons)  

 * Software PWM Matrix (for passive LED matrices)  

 * HT1632 based LED matrix displays such as the Sure Electronics DE-DP105 (search for 0832 led matrix on Ebay)
