# Baud rate register calculator

Uploaded by CKupelian on 2007-11-09 11:43:00 (rating 0 out of 5)

## Summary

type in the crystal frequency and the desired baud rate and click update.  

It gives the UBRRH and UBRRL values, actual baud rates, and the % deviation for the two values that bracket the baud rate you want. For Windows. 


Send me a note if you find something wrong, want a feature, or just plain find it useful. I'll eventually add tabs for other calculations as I need them.


I am not an AVR expert, so if it doesn't work with some models I can add a disclaimer page.


Thanks to SPAMIAM for finding my first bug! Now works with non-integer crystal and baud values.


Cheers!
