SBI Changelog

---- 05/04/2012 -- Version 0.1 -------------------------------------------------
Know bugs:
- Very slow
- Only 3 parameters for user's functions
- User's functions can't access program variables bidirectionally
- SASMC has a lot of bugs...

Fixes:
- None

Notes:
- First release
- Slow because:
	a.	8 byte instructions (take a lot of time to read 8 bytes from the SD with
			Petit FatFs and another lot to execute)
	b.	Some startup time required to scan all the program in search of labels
