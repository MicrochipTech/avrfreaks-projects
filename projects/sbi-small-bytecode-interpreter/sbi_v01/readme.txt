SBI is a bytecode interpreter for a custom executable format written by
me (see <doc> folder).

It was originally designed to run programs from a SD card on an Atmega16
microcontroller, without reprogramming it.

There are the following directories:

<doc>		Documentation on SBI format and SASM programming
<examples>	Examples for PC and AVR
<sasmc>		SASM compiler
<sbi>		SBI interpreter (generic source)
