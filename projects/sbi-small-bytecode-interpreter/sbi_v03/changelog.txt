SBI Changelog

---- 09/04/2012 -- Version 0.3 -------------------------------------------------
New stuff:
- Added clean option to SASMC
- Subroutines concatenation can now be implemented easly (added return addresses
  array)
- Labels now are in the index of the SBI executable file
  (no label scan required	> initialization time reduced
   no label instruction in code	> less instructions > a little bit faster)

Know bugs:
- (AVR) Flash usage is bigger than the previous version

Fixes:
- Programs size now is lower
- Exit command now must be used with 0 parameters
- Fast review of <sbi.txt> and <sasm.txt> document files

Notes:
- SASMC now creates a temporary file ('.sbi.prg'), you can remove this
  automatically after the compilation using the option '-cl'
- Changed sintax of SASMC
- Buffered PC example renamed to 'pcbuff' (from 'pc-b')

---- 06/04/2012 -- Version 0.2 -------------------------------------------------
New stuff:
- SASMC rewrote in C++
- Added silent option to SASMC
- Added 'pc-b' example, which is an example using the buffered reading functions

Know bugs:
- (AVR) Flash usage is bigger than the previous version

Fixes:
- Speed improved (remember to use buffered read functions!)
- Programs size now is lower
- 8 bidirectional parameters for user's functions
- SASMC now shows error and parses all the code correctly

Notes:
- Changed sintax of SASMC
- In the next release labels addresses will be defined in the SBI file, so the
  initialization will take less time and the AVR flash usage will be lower

---- 05/04/2012 -- Version 0.1 -------------------------------------------------
Know bugs:
- Very slow
- Only 3 parameters for user's functions
- User's functions can't access program variables bidirectionally
- SASMC has a lot of bugs...

Fixes:
- None

Notes:
- First release
- Slow because:
	a.	8 byte instructions (take a lot of time to read 8 bytes from the SD with
		Petit FatFs and another lot to execute)
	b.	Some startup time required to scan all the program in search of labels
