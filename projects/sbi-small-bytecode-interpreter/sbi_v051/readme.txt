SBI - Small Bytecode Interpreter
by Gi@cky98

Version 0.51

REMEMBER: To improve speed use buffered read functions
(see /examples/pcbuff and /examples/avr).

SBI is a bytecode interpreter for a custom executable format written by
me (see <doc> folder).

It was originally designed to run programs from a SD card on an Atmega16
microcontroller, without reprogramming it.

There are the following directories:

<doc>		Documentation on SBI format and SASM programming
<examples>	Examples for PC and AVR
<sasmc>		SASM compiler
<sbi>		SBI interpreter (generic source)
<screens>	Screenshots
<syntax>	SASMC language keywords and INI file for PSPad Editor
