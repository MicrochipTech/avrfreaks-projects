PSPad INI file for SASM sintax highlighting

Copy the Syntax folder to PSPad installation folder and merge the content.
Then open PSPad and go to Settings>Highlighters Settings and select an <not assigned> voice.
On the right part of the dialog select 'SASM'. Now check the voice on the listbox on the left.

Good luck! :)
