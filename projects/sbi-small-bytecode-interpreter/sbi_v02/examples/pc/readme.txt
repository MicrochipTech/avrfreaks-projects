---- Windows PC Example of SBI ------------------------------------------------

Type 'make' in the command prompt to build this example and the relative
example programs.

'sbi.exe' will be compiled. This is a simple SBI runtime for Windows, with 2
simple functions loaded.

The command-line sintax is the following:
	sbi <program.sbi>

When you have compiled this example, type 'sbi programs/counter.sbi' to run a
counter program, that counts and prints numbers from 0 to 9.
You can also run 'programs/pow.sbi', a program that executes the pow of
a number, or 'programs/libtest.sbi', which demostrates how to run custom user
functions from a SBI program.
