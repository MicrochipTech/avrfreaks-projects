## Summary

A small windows command line tool that takes a text file with variable descriptions similar to c and returns an eeprom hex file (16bit Intel Hex) and outputs a definition file for inclusion in your project. I've included a sample input file (test.c) and a sample command line (test.bat). Upon completion it returns a header file, a hex file and an info file. Use the -h or -? switches for usage details (v8. Another small fix and changed default input file to .c).
