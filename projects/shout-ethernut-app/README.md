## Summary

UPDATED!


This application demonstrates how to create a  

bare bone, stand alone internet radio. It is able to  

directly play Shoutcast streams. This is experimental  

code and may not work as expected. Some C  

programming experience is required.


New in Version 1.1.0  

- HTTP server added to select radio stations with a webbrowser.  

- Added support for ImageCraft C.


An ATmega 128 equipped Ethernut Board with programming  

adapter or similar hardware and a VS1001K MP3 decoder  

board are required to run the binary, which is supplied  

in Intel hex format for ATmega128.  

Schematics and board layouts are available at
