## Summary

This is an update to an older version of my program. 2313Temper8 is an assembly language program for a 10MHZ AT90S2313. It can read up to 8 DS1820 or DS18S20 temperature sensors. It read the ROM IDs of all the detected devices and calculate the extended temperature for the selected device. The data is returned via the serial port.  

The routines to calculate the extended temperature have been tested to work over the range of the DS18S20 (+85C to -55C) and matches the values shown on the DS18S20 data sheet.  

Check my web page at [http://frank.bol.ucla.edu/2313Te...](http://frank.bol.ucla.edu/2313Temper8.htm) for the latest version.
