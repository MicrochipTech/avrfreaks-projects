## Summary

Use this project to generate 8 bit sounds like in the 80's. 


This program tries to emulate the sound chip SID of the famous historical C64 Commodore computer (SID = Sound Interface Device).  

The SID emulator includes all registers of the original SID, only minor functions are not implemented yet.


You might probably want to use that project to build a very simple 8 bit synthesizer
