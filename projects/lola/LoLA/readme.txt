Correction 02.Nov.2007:
PCB-Size was wrong in Part-List



This project describes an 8-Channel Logic-Analyzer and
Pulse-Generator for hobby-purposes, based on the Atmel
AVR-Controller AT90S1200 (16MHz).

The Controller-Sourcefile is for the Atmel AVRASM-Assembler.

The User-Interfaces LOLA.EXE for the Logic-Analyzer and
PGEN.EXE for the Pulse-Generator are written in Delphi.
There are 16-bit versions (LoLA16.EXE, PGen16.EXE) for
Windows 3.1/3.11  and 32-bit versions (LoLA32.EXE, PGen32.EXE)
for Windows 9x.
