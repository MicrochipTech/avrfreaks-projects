LoLA.EXE update v0.20

There was a problem with LoLA.EXE running on some PCs.
When closing the Comm-Interface, these PCs sent something
on the TxD-Line (maybe a break). The LogicLogger takes
this for the first parameter-byte and when started again,
the last parameter-byte sent results in a break for the
just started record. So only the cleared sample-buffer
was transfered to the PC...
I developed the program on a P133 with Win95  and tested
it on an old 486DX50 and on a P120 (also both with Win95)
without problems. The program should also run in school
on two old 486s with Win3.11 (therefor Delphi-1), but on
both PCs the behaviour described before occures.
To solve this problem, LoLA.EXE resets the LogicLogger
and removes so any byte received before. The RESET is
done with the DTR-Line on the communication-interface.
There is a schematic in the file "RESET.PNG" for this
extension. 
Please use it, if you had the same trouble!
