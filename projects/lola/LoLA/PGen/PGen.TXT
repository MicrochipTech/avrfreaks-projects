The Pulse-Generator "Add-On" for the LoLA-LogicAnalyzer.

First Note: It is not possible to run the PulseGenerator
and LogicAnalyzer at the same time! The MicroController
can not run both functions together. 

Please copy the PulseGenerator-Software into the directory
where LOLA.EXE is located. Both Programs share the same
configuration (LOLA.CFG) for the Interface-Port.
The Interface-Port must be set with LOLA.EXE !

The Controller-Software must be LOLA15.ASM (LOLA15.HEX).

Hardware-Changes:

The PulseGenerator uses the Controller Output PD3.
This signal is now connected to the Reset-Input for the
Counter 74HC4040 (Pin 11), but is never used.

* Cut the track at the 74HC4040 Pin 11 and place a wire
  from this Pin to GND (74HC4040 Pin 8).
* Cut the track at the AT90S1200 Pin 7 and place 
  a wire from this Pin to the Pulse-Out-Connector.

The PulseGenerator generates also a short Trigger-Pulse
at the beginning of a Pulse-Period or a Burst.
If you want to use this Trigger-Pulse, add a wire at the
AT90S1200 Pin 8 (PD4) to the Trigger-Connector.
(In LogicAnalyzer-Mode this pin is used for sampling the
input-register).


The PulseGenerator features:

* Programmable Pulse-High-Time (Ti) from 1us to ca. 8sec
* Programmable Pulse-Low-Time (Tp) in the same range.
* Programmable Duty-Cycle, Periode-Time or Frequency
* Continuous- or Burst-Mode.

The Generator works internal in two Ranges.
Range-1 is from 1us to 16384.75us in 250ns steps.
Range-2 is from 125us to 8191ms in steps to 125us.
The software selects automatically the matching range,
but the range for Ti and Tp must be the same. So it is
not possible to set Ti to 10us and Tp to 50ms because
Ti is in Range-1 and Tp in Range-2. In this mismatch
one Input-Field is colored yellow to signalyze that
a value is out of range.


Handling the PulseGenerator-Software:

After starting the EXE-File, the Controller is resetted
(see extension for DTR-Reset).

There are Edit-Fields to enter the parameters.

When changing the values for Ti or Tp, these values are
automatically rounded to the nearest possible value
thats programmable. 
For example: 10.2us is rounded to 10.25us.

If something is entered that's not a value, the Edit-
Field is colored red.

If a value entered that's out of range, the Edit-Field
is colored yellow.

With invalid values for Ti or Tp the START-Button is
disabled.

By clicking on the units for Ti or Tp, these can be
swapped between us and ms (but this has no influence
to the range).

There is one Edit-Field colored gray. This parameter
is locked and cannot be edited. 
So if the Pw-Field (Duty-Cycle) is locked and the
parameter for Ti is changed, Tp is automatically
changed to a new value that matches the prescripted
Duty-Cycle.
If Periode and Frequency are locked and the Duty-Cycle
Pw is changed, Ti and Tp are recalculated so that the
sum gives the predefined Periode-Time (=Frequency).

The parameter to lock is selected with the Radio-
Button. Because Periode-Time and Frequency mean the
same, both are selected together.

The Display shows the edited parameter.
CONT is in Continuous-Mode and BURST in Burst-Mode.
The status shows "NoConnect" if no acknowledge was
sent by the Controller (thats after program-start). 
The Controller is connected with the START-Button. 
The status changes to "Running" until BREAK is
pressed or, in Burst-Mode, the Generator has stopped.
The status then switches to "Idle".
In the lower-right corner are one or two stars, 
standing for the selected range.
 

The Pulses begin with the LOW-Phase (Tp). Timing:

~~~~~~~~V~~~~~~~~V~~~~~~~~V~~~~~~~~V~  Trigger (PD4)

___________~~~~~____~~~~~____~~~~~___  Pulse   (PD3)


In Burst-Mode:

~~~~~~~~V~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Trigger (PD4)

___________~~~~~____~~~~~____~~~~~___  Pulse   (PD3)


 
When entering a valid parameter and pressing the RETURN-
Key, the Generator is (re-)started immediately (without
a click on the START-Button).
If the hardware is not connected or no acknowledge was
sent before, the RESET-Line (DTR) is activated (Status-
LED bright yellow). So, when the hardware works properly,
there is no delay when the Generator is (re-)started.
  

Enjoy!
