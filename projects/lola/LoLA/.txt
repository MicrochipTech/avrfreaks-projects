============================
LoLA 8-Channel LogicAnalyzer
============================

This Program works in combination with the 
sampling-hardware, which is mainly an ATMEL
AT90S1200 Controller with a 2k-RAM device.

The diagram-window shows 8 channels (CH0..CH7).
Below this window are the buttons to zoom and 
move the diagram.
The yellow bar shows the visible part of the
full 2k memory. This bar can be moved with the
mouse.

Cursor-1 is set by clicking the left mousebutton,
Cursor-2 by clicking the right mousebutton in the
diagram-window.

The "Lock"-checkbox keeps the selected part of
the diagram when new sampled data is shown. This
is useful in Auto-Repeat-Mode, where after each
datatransmission a new record is started.
The "T"-button brings the triggermark back into
the window if it was outside. Also both cursors
can be fetched by clicking on the blue or green
positionfield.
The checkmark below the "T"-button marks all
samples which match with the triggerword.

The "Break"-button stops recording and all data
captured so far will be displayed.


The LogicLogger works in 6 modes.

The Timing-Modes:

Mode 0: internal trigger, internal clock.
        The internal trigger is set by the
        TriggerWord. Allowed are: "1" or "H"
        for high, "0" or "L" for low and "X"
        for a don't-care bit.
        The internal samplerate is selectable
        from 2us to 16ms.

Mode 1: internal trigger, external clock on
        rising edge. (Positive clock)
        The input for the external clock is CH0.

Mode 2: like mode 1, but external clock on the
        falling edge. (Negative clock)

Mode 3: internal Clock, external trigger on
        rising edge. (Positive trigger)
        Trigger-input is channel-0.

Mode 4: like mode 3, but external trigger on the
        falling edge. (Negative trigger)

The State-Mode:

Mode 5: This mode has no sample-clock and no
        triggercondition.
        All changes at the 8 input-channels are
        recorded without any relation to the time.


The Pre-Trigger value defines how many samples are
taken after the trigger has occured.
After starting in the modes 0, 1 and 2 the data
is continuously sampled and stored in memory. When
the triggerevent occures, a predefined number of
samples is taken. For example: this number is 1023
for 50% Pre-Trigger. The triggermark is shown in
the middle of the timingdiagram, with the data
captured before and after the triggerevent.
This can work only if before the trigger occures,
enough data is sampled. So if the trigger comes
immediately after start, only data after trigger
is recorded. The part on the screen left from the
triggermark is "empty" (data is 00).
In the modes 3 and 4 (external trigger) generally
no data is stored before trigger occurs!


The Menu:

File:      Info opens an editor to comment the data.
           This text is stored with the datafile.
           255 chars max. are allowed.      
 
Interface: Select the COM-port to the logger.

SelfTest:  The LogicLogger can produce test-
           signals for checking hard- and soft-
           ware. The testpattern are taken from
           the 2k-RAM (sample-buffer).


Analyze:   The data from cursor-1 to cursor-2
           is analyzed.

           The I2C-BUS-Analysis evaluates the
           datastream from an I2C-communication,
           which was recorded before.
           SCLK must be connected to CH0 and SDAT
           to CH1.
           Suitable is the state-mode where every
           change on SCLK and SDAT is captured.

           For the LCD-Analysis recording in state-
           mode is also advantageous. 
           The connections are: CH0 to Enable,
           CH1 to Register-Select, CH2 to Write
           and CH4, CH5, CH6 and CH7 to the data-
           lines D4..D7. (4-Bit-Mode only!) 
           The analyzer lists read and write access
           to the command- and data-register, the
           nibbles transfered and the characters.       

           Dump lists the samplebuffer between
           cursor-1 and cursor-2 (incl.). It shows
           the decimal values for address and data
           and can be useful for export.     
 
           Copy to Clipboard copies all the text, so
           it can pasted into notepad and saved.

 
Keyboard-control:
To move the timing-diagram:
   "Pos 1" jumps to begin of memory (Addr. 0000).
   "End" jumps to end of memory (Addr. 2047).
   "Pg. up" and "Pg. down" to shift diagram by 1 
   position, in combination with "Ctrl" shift by 
   16 positions.
With "F10" the Pull-Down-Menu is activated, then use 
the Cursorkeys and Return-Key or "ESC" to leave.
"Alt-Print" is a Win95/98 command to make a screenshot
from the programwindow in clipboard.
"Alt-F4" closes the program immediately...

Have fun!
