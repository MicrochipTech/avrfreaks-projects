## Summary

Philips latest protocol is called RCMM, I have not yet found any information on how it works, just that I must buy a licence to get the spec. So, I used an oscilloscope and a Nokia remotecontrol to "hand-hack" the protocol.  

Anyway, this file should not be hard to use in another project. Example included. Software is adapted for 2313 and 4MHz oscillator, but can easily be changed.
