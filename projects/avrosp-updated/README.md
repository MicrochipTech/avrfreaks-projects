# AVROSP Updated

Uploaded by priyend on 2010-02-15 13:04:00 (rating 0 out of 5)

## Summary

This modification is based on the AVR911 open source programmer AVROSP for the AVR range of micros.


The modifications done are:  

1. Added support for COM ports ranging from COM01 to COM99. This will  

allow one to use virtual serial ports for programming since they are  

usually assigned high COM numbers beyond 8. The default will scan all COM ports from 1 to 99 as with the auto scan feature of the project.  

2. Added a switch '-B' to specify the baud rate to be used from 300 to 115200 baud. The default is set to 115200 baud.


Bug fix release Rev 1.1: COM port addresses below 10 now work properly.
