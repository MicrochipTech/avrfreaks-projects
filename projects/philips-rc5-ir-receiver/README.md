## Summary

Updated 7 jan 2003  

Fixed error: IR-module was on port PD3, should be PD2 for int0


*********************  

Easy to use RC5 decoder, not as fancy as Atmels appnote410, but doesnÂ´t use any interrupt.  

Routine and example included. Software is adapted for 2313 and 4MHz oscillator, but can easily be changed.


Examples of usage:  

I use it as a part of my home control system, where I use it for the lamps, the fan and the computer media machine.  

Also to use in robotic-projects.
