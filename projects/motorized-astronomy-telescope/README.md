## Summary

This is online translation from french (sorry for my poor English): Require an equatorial mounting having two movements RA and DEC equipped with endless screw on toothed wheel. (and not not a screw + butted against the variation as in finds some on certain cheap mountings). * Single assembly controlling the engine of right ascension AND that of variation (engines step by step). * With posting of the 2 infos on the same bill-poster, LCD 4 lines of 20 characters, backlighted (blue). * Compensation of terrestrial rotation (followed in right ascension). * Slow and fast speeds, up to 16 or 32 times sidereal speed (according to engine and mechanics…) * Assembly based on one microcontrolor AVR ATmega32 programmed directly in PASCAL (under AVRco), turning with 16MHz. * Remote piloting with a simple remote control universal TV. * Function GOTO. * Positions of many stars of reference memorized in the EEPROM of ATmega32. * The assembly can also be connected to the PC by a connection USB before the field use , in order to program the internal data. * The assembly (chart PEAK of engine control and postings + remote control IR) can function WITHOUT the ordi, in an autonomous way. * The assembly can also be connected to the PC by a connection USB during the use, this which makes it possible to point million stars. * Evolutionary assembly since ATmega are reprogrammable uContrôleurs flash.
