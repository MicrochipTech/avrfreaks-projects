## Summary

This robot is to be used for working with neural networks. It has a considerable amount of documentation (64 page report), including an overview of how neural networks work. 


The project is not quite done yet, although most of it is. I will continue to update this as the project continues.


It includes much C code, VHDL, schematics, and documention. May be useful if you want to see:


--colour object tracking using CMUCam  

--my own communications protocol called the StannBus using a backplane design  

--motor speed controller  

--FRAM access  

--using SONAR  

--lots of other stuff
