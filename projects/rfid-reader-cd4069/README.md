## Summary

Hi.


Here is my last project for RFID reader for ATmega16 (is possible to use all MCU ..), demodulator is used CD4069. 125kHz is generated from PWM 16Mhz crystal.


This is better than using EM4069.


Code is easy and decode in real time , but used 400us wait in INT0 .


Â 


Best regards.
