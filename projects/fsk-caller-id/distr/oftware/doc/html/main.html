Introduction</a></h2>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="what_in">
What's in this package</a></h3>
This package contains a routine that can fetch caller-ID's from a telephone line and show it on an LCD.<p>
The caller-ID is the telephone number of the one who is calling to you. This number, along with the date and time of the call is sent to you by your telephone company.<p>
Your telephone company must use the ITU-Rec.V23bis, otherwise this project won't work. It means that your telephone company must send the data to you using FSK (frequency shift keying). Which means that the digital ones and zeros of the data have their own frequencies. A one is sent using a 1300Hz sine, a zero is sent by a 2100Hz sine. I use the Exar XR-2211 chip to decode these frequencies to digital zeroes and ones.<p>
In many countries another modulation, namely DTMF is used. This project will NOT work with this modulation. You will need another decoding chip, an MT8870.<p>
This project is actually very basic. If someone calls, his/her number, including the date and time are shown on the LCD. Then the microcontroller becomes blocked. You have to reset it to receive the number of the next caller.<p>
So there remains still a lot of work to be done if you want to use it in a real application.<h2><a class="anchor" name="info">

I read a lot more information than what is given here below. I only give you the relevant data in this section.<p>

Datasheets</a></h2>
I have downloaded some datasheets of different manufacturers. Some contain errors. In some datasheets they choose completely different component values and the calculations are also different. So be careful when reading them.<p>

This application note from Exar proved most useful to me:<p>
