## Summary

Once upon a time, I needed to do the same thing as described in the AVR446 application note. But I didn't have the IAR Systems compiler, so I ported the code for the AVR-Studio and WINAVR. Just recently! After the facing of some problems everything worked fine. So here it is for all of us, who like AVRs, gcc and stepper motors. The code is ported for ATmega8535.
