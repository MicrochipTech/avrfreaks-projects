Basic Parts list. I won't include part numbers since they are all very common parts.

Transmitter:
Qty	Part
1	TLP434A module (transmitter)
1	AT90S2313-10PI 
I used industrial ones because the transmitter is outside
and sometimes the temperature will get down to -30C!

So far the lowest temperature we had was -12C. The unit still works well.
Since the battery is only connected when the mailbox is opened, I am hoping that it will
last all winter.

1	4MHz crystal
2	22pF capacitors
1	1Mohm resistor
1	4.7K resistor
1	0.1uF Capacitor
1	7805 Voltage regulator

1	Normally Open Magnet Switch
(I used Mode part# 47-600-0) Go to:

Receiver:
Qty	Part
1	RLP434A module (receiver)
1	90S2313 Avr (doesn't need to be industrial because its in the warm house)
1	4MHz crystal
2	22pF capacitors
1	1Mohm resistor
1	4.7K resistor
1	470 ohm resistor
1	220 ohm resistor
1 	LED
1	0.1uF Capacitor
1	7805 Voltage regulator
1	2.1mm DC jack
1	5V Buzzer
1	DC Power adapter 9 - 12VDC
1	100uF Capacitor

For an antenna, I stripped the inner conductor copper
from an RG6 TV cable (7" long) and soldered it directly
to the ANT pin on each module.
