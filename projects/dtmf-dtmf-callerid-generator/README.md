Uploaded by behzad_khazama on 2007-06-05 09:15:00 (rating 0 out of 5)

## Summary

This project is based on atmel application note 314 .  

I have ported that appnote to atmega8 and modify it to work better.  

and for an example of how u can use it I have wrote an example to generate(or simulate) 'DTMF callerID' signals.
