## Summary

The MSF signal originally transmitted from Rugby is now transmitted from Anthorn in the UK (latitude 54o 54’ N, longitude 3o 16’ W). 


It is the principal means of discriminating the UK national time and frequency which are maintained by the National Physical Laboratory (NPL).


The signal strength is >10mV/m at 100km and >100uV/m at 1000km from the source it has a carrier frequency of 60kHz within 2 parts in 10000000000000. 


The MSF time and date code is serially transmitted using simple on-off carrier modulation. The timing edge is governed by the seconds and minutes of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) which is always within 1s of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). 


This project uses the MSF signal to keep accurate time and date on a 2x16 character LCD module.
