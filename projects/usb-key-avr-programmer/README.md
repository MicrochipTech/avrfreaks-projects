## Summary

That's my version of the popular USBasp, an open source USB AVR programmer design from Thomas Fischl.


My version is a USB key-like design, using many SMD parts and a very small PCB. You can take it with you everywhere!


As the original version, this works only with 5V targets.


The project page with schematics, layout and fimware is available [here](http://fabiobaltieri.com/2011/09/02/usb-key-avr-programmer/).
