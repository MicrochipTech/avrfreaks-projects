## Summary

Complete article, code and schematic of a black-box we installed on a '87 Porsche 911 engine.


To upgrade the horsepower output of the engine, a different  

air-mass-meter was installed on the engine and the black-box  

with the Atmel does a signal conversion to adapt for the change.  

With the integrated RS232 port, the fuel-mixture can be modified online with the engine running.
