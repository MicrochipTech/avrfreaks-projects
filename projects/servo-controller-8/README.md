## Summary

***Name Change. Found an earlier project on this site with the same name. This project was named Super Simple Servo Controller. *** Simple schematics and hardware makes this project easy to build for a beginner. Other than headers it just uses 2 capacitors, 1 resistor, 1 crystal and 1 AVR (ATmega88). Schematic file can be viewed with the free version of Eagle Layout Editor. Uses SPI for communication with another micro/computer. Schematics and code can be easily changed to use the USART instead of the SPI.
