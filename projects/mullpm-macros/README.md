# MUL/LPM-macros

## Summary

This set of macros extends the instruction set of a regular AT90S part to the instruction set of an ATmega part except for (of course) SPM. They are trying to emulate the original instructions as close as possible (including setting the status bits) and can be converted to subroutines easily (recommended if they are used many times in the program). Please read the "CAUTION"s in the header of each macro! I wrote these macros because I wanted to test "mega"-code with my ICE200. A test routine for each macro is included. Considarations are code space and speed.
