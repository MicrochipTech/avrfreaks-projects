## Summary

This routine have implemented function for generate pin signals to function SHARP displays 240x320 pixels resolution


Displays:  

 For all displays SHARP who containes next pin function:


Clk  

LP  

SPL  

CLS  

PS  

SPS  

VCOM  

MOD


For exemple:  

Sharp LQ035Q7DB02


For Displays datasheet visit my site:

The routine in software mode, makes refrash for the display 240x320 with 10fps Atmega64 16Mhz Clock


This routine is perfect to make a program that reads from a external memory ram and post (the read file) to display with 10 FPS


10 Fps are enough for the display to post images knowing that the display has no video memory included and if it is no refresh at the display the post images will vanish little by little in approximative 10 sec from the post up.
