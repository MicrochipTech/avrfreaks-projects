## Summary

This creature will seek light to feed his battery with his attached solar. When he has found the best spot, it turns in sleep mode and chills. When the intensity of the light is to low or somewhere else is more light to be found,he will seek a new spot to relax. With his little brain he will learn little things to make the search for light easier. My new bot will have my own Real Time Kernel (A.T.A.K.) for multitasking. <http://www.fictoor.nl/irbot>
