## Summary

This is the complete refined code for an Atmega168pu-based communication Aid System (ComAidSystem)to assist on-road communication with a deaf driver. The system includes a ps2-keyboard, an Atmega168pu microcontroller and an lcd.


ComAidSystem is a project to develop a communication system to enable a passenger to communicate with a deaf driver while on the road. The system is supposed to help communication without the need for the deaf driver to take eyes off the road.


The basic components for the system are a ps-2 keyboard, an Atmega168p microcontroller and a 16-char LCD display (NHD-0116GZ-FSW-FBW). The passenger will just have to type words on the keyboard or execute a keyboard command that will display text on an LCD screen placed on top of the dashboard.
