## Summary

The ADC module is configured to work with 12 bit resolution, left ajustment, free run mode and unsigned single-ended input. Connecting a trimmer's cursor into pin A2 and without exceeding 3.3V (maximum voltage for a xmega microcontroller's input), the program will read and convert this value into a voltage variable, vin. If you don't have a debugger, you can transform this variable into eight bits and show the result on a row of leds.
