# Ambient Color: RGB Network-Light

Uploaded by hb9tws on 2010-11-21 21:30:00 (rating 0 out of 5)

## Summary

This project is about an RGB-Light that can be controlled via IP-Multicast. As hardware the AVR-NET-IO from Pollin ([www.pollin.de](http://www.pollin.de)) is used. This boards bears a AT Mega-32 processor and an Ethernet-IC.


The source code implements a simple receiver for IP-Multicasts and an PWM-controller for RGB-LEDs.


As controller either a Windows program or an Windows mobile app can be use. The Windows programm is free, the Windows mobile costs about 2.5 US Dollars since I had to buy some expensive UI-Components for it.


A project description (in German) can be found on my website [http://www.heesch.net/rgb-netzwe...](http://www.heesch.net/rgb-netzwerkleuchte.aspx).
