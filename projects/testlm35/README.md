## Summary

This is my test.  

I wanted to try the AD converter.  

I wrote the program in assembly language, by copying examples from the Atmel website or some devotee electronics like me.


I used an LCD with HD44780 driver (the most common) to display the temperature value converted.  

The displayed value is not be very accurate, this is because I never had the desire to improve the program.
