## Summary

Qualia is a free (FLOSS) software library for agent-based systems written in simple C++. It is meant to run on embedded devices as well as on general purpose computers, with a specific focus on AVR microcontrollers. It makes it easy for designers, artists and researchers to experiment with different sorts of agents (reinforcement learning, finite state machines, cellular automata, etc) and environments (simulation, physical/embedded, network-based, etc).
