## Summary

A detailed explanation of the steps and code changes needed to install  

a bootloader on an ATMega32 chip. Code and schematic of breadboard  

setup are included. The OptiBoot bootloader is used by the Arduino board  

and requires less than 512 byte of flash. The resulting breadboard will be  

able to load & run Arduino sketches.
