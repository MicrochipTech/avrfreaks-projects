## Summary

This small function is for Calibrating OSCCAL using external 32kHz crystal.  

I have seen multiple implementation of OSCCAL calibration methods. from too complicated calibration in AVR Butterfly firmware to mulitple samples in Atmel appnote AVR055. AVR Freaks too has a design note DN018.  

Both Atmel and AVR Freaks code was based on IAR compiler, this code is based on avrlibc and gcc.  

I implemented Simple search defined in Atmel app note.
