## Summary

This is another simple handheld LED game. I've implemented Rock, Paper, Scissors. A complete write up of the hardware can be found at <http://mricheyprojects.googlepages.com/home3>. I've posted the code and the Makefile. Feel free to contact me with any questions, but it should be pretty easy and self explanatory.
