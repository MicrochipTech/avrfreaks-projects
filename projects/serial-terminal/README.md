## Summary

This is a 4 line 20 character per line terminal. It uses the atmel application note on interfaceing an at keyboard to allow it to use a standard pc keyboard to enter text.


The pcb leaves alot to be desired as it is mostly an auto route but I was in a hurry to compleate this. So if you feel like it you could probably redesign the pcb from the schematic and get a much smaller board or even get it down to single sided.
