# Arduino Debug Tool

Uploaded by visual_micro on 2012-06-15 10:23:00 (rating 0 out of 5)

## Summary

The tool allows conditional trace and breakpoints to be configured inside Visual Studio. Code injection during compilation ensures users never need to hack their arduino programs to add debug messages.


The debug tool currently runs over serial either via direct cable of xbee, bluetooth etc.
