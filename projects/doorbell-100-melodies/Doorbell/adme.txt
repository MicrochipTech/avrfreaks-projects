This little project ("Doorbell" in german "Klingel") ist left from last X-mas, I builded it for my nephews.

Some ideas are taken from the web - thanks to Hannes Lux (www.hanneslux.de) and www.mikrocontroller.net (Pseudo-Random Generator).

Hardware:

The circuit is driven by 3 AA cells (they should last for years).

The ring is started by the AC from your "old" bell installation - OK1 is only for protection.

If you know what you are doing, you can omit OK1.

If you want to start the bell by a simple switch, you can omit R1, D1, OK1 - connect the switch to C3/PB2 and GND. 


Software:

Fuses: uncheck CKDIV8 fuse! (full 8 MHz internal speed)

The hex and eep file are builded with AVR-Studio 4.13 and Win-AVR 20070525.
