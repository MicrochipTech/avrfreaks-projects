-- The following code must appear in the VHDL architecture header:

------------- Begin Cut here for COMPONENT Declaration ------ COMP_TAG
component mult12
	port (
	a: IN std_logic_VECTOR(5 downto 0);
	p: OUT std_logic_VECTOR(12 downto 0));
end component;

-- Synplicity black box declaration
attribute syn_black_box : boolean;
attribute syn_black_box of mult12: component is true;

-- COMP_TAG_END ------ End COMPONENT Declaration ------------

-- The following code must appear in the VHDL architecture
-- body. Substitute your own instance name and net names.

------------- Begin Cut here for INSTANTIATION Template ----- INST_TAG
your_instance_name : mult12
		port map (
			a => a,
			p => p);
-- INST_TAG_END ------ End INSTANTIATION Template ------------

-- You must compile the wrapper file mult12.vhd when simulating
-- the core, mult12. When compiling the wrapper file, be sure to
-- reference the XilinxCoreLib VHDL simulation library. For detailed
-- instructions, please refer to the "CORE Generator Help".
