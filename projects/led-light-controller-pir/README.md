## Summary

This project (described fully at <http://blog.unixbigot.id.au/2009/11/simple-presence-sensing-led-lighting.html>) uses an ATTiny45 microcontroller to allow LED lighting to be switched on and off by a PIR motion sensor and by a normal push button.


A single push button serves as an off-on switch and as a dimmer. It is indended for energy-efficient night-lighting, eg in bathrooms and hallways.
