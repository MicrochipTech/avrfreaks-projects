## Summary

This project is about a wireless controlled RGB light. For connection to the WLAN a WIFI module containing the ZG2100M is used. The ZG2100M is connected to the ATMega using the SPI bus.


The ZG2100 supports WPA and WEP encryption out of the box. A detailed description can be found on [http://www.heesch.net/wireless-r...](http://www.heesch.net/wireless-rgb.aspx) in German language.


Schematics and code are attached to this short description as well as a small windows program that can be used to control the RGB light from the network.
