## Summary

This is a small project but for musicians who would like to teach other about tempo and quarters (4/4 or 3/3) this project can via different colored LEDs easy bring an overview of the tempo tones.


It is made with use of a mega8 and the tone is made with PWM channel of a timer2.  

The BPM tempo is set with buttons and calculated using timer1.  

The setting is shown using 7-segment LCDs and multiplexing the 4 segments.


Both source code and schematic and also board layout can be downloaded from my homepage. A video of the operation is also available.
