# SPI Interface to an LIS3LV02DQ 3

## Summary

Simple project, using an ATmega8 as found in an Arduino board to interface with a 3-axis accelerometer produced by ST called the LIS3LV02DQ. Demonstrates how to use the register-based features of the device.


N.B. That the code is "Wiring", a superset of avr-gcc. There are two methods used in the code that can be easily ported to raw avr-gcc: Serial.print, digitalWrite and pinMode. These are just abstractions of code to write to the serial port, set a pin to either on or off, and set the direction of a pin ï¿½ all functions that are easily translated to avr-gcc.
