This is a practical example of driving multiplexed LED_based 7_segments project.
This is a Battery Tester and have 3 multiplexed digits with current amplifire and nearly use the same subroutines but have more complexity becouse this practical example calculate some equations and obtain internal battery resistance.
At the first connection, voltage will be indicated for 1 second and then the internal static battery resistance in miliohm will be indicated.
The "internal static battery resistance" is equal to battery life time. So, briefly this is a battery_lifetime_indicator.

Absolute maximum rating:
Input Voltage: 5.5V
Reverse voltage: 10 seconds at 4.2v, 60 seconds at 3.5v.

If you want to buy this project, mail me to inform you more about it.
sincerely yours. A.Hooshangian
