Short description:
A low cost method to drive mutiplexed 7-segmet(LED_Based) displays.
For example: using only one MCU (ATMEGA8L) for both processing your program and Display the results.

Long description:
LED_based multiplexed 7-segment displays are always a problem for beginners to drive correctly, Exactly when main process & display process combined together.

So i decide to show you, how you can drive it as easey as possible at lowest price.
This Example designed for 4digits(common anode) multiplexed display. See table below:

    7Segment  | AVR I/O |    I/O
     digits   |   need  | Condition
   -----------|---------|----------
     2 digits | 2+8=10  |  output
              |         |
     3 digits | 3+8=11  |  output
              |         |
     4 digits | 4+8=12  |  output
              |         |
     5 digits | 5+8=13  |  output
        .     |    .    |    .
        .     |    .    |    .
        .     |    .    |    .

For Example: If you have 4 digits multiplexed 7segment, therefore 12 pins will be occupied only for display.
Consider ATMega8L (23 Total_I/O - 12 used_I/O) = 11 pins free to use for another works.

Depend on 7segment current dissipation; you may need current amplifier (transistor) to make more brightness.

How can i know, if i need "current amplifire" ?
Ans: connect a 2mA source current(+5v series with 1.2k resistor) to one segment(One LED), if the brightness is enough, you don't need transistor for current amplifier.

Here it is the link, you can download the sources and a practical example:
