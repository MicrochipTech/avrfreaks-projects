## Summary

The project implements a soldering base station for an existing 80 Watts soldering iron (WPS80,WP80). On the project website  

[http://www.eosystems.ro/index.ph...](http://www.eosystems.ro/index.php/projects/esol)  

you can find the complete source code for ATMEGA164 microcontroller, the PCBs printouts and the construction details. Here are some project highlights:  

- very compact (smaller that Weller's original device)  

- 80W power drive of the soldering iron by onboard MOSFET  

- nice contrast LED display with 3 digits  

- easy to use temperature adjustments by rotary encoder knob and/or multifunctional buttons  

- software PID temperature control loop  

- very fast heating time  

- good temperature stability (2-3 Celsius degrees)  

- open source code available as GPLv3 license
