## Summary

The project consists of a Real Time Clock which is implemented using Timer1 at 8MHz frequency. It uses ATMega32 along with STK500. LCD JHD162A is used for output and push button switches is used as input.  

The user gives the desired time for the system to function. When the timer reaches the desired time, the system start. I have written about the implementation of the project in the documentation. The code is also in the appendix of the documentation. This project was done by me along with my 4 univ colleagues.
