## Summary

The Mark3 Realtime Kernel is a completely free, open-source, real-time operating system aimed at bringing multitasking to microcontroller systems without MMUs. It uses modern programming languages and concepts (it's written entirely in C++) to minimize code duplication, and its object-oriented design enhances readibility. The API is simple - there are only six functions required to set up the kernel, initialize threads, and start the scheduler. The source is fully-documented with example code provided to illustrate concepts. The result is a performant RTOS, which is easy to read, easy to understand, and easy to extend to fit your needs. But Mark3 is bigger than just a real-time kernel, it also contains a number of class-leading features: Device driver HAL which provides a meaningful abstraction around device-specific peripherals. Capable recursive-make driven build system which can be used to build all libraries, examples, tests, and documentation for any number of targets from the command-line. Graphics and UI code designed to simplify the implementation of systems using displays, keypads, joysticks, and touchscreens Standards-based custom communications protocol used to simplify the creation of host tools A bulletproof, well-documented bootloader for AVR microcontrollers
