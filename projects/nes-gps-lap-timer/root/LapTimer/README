This project effects a GPS enabled lap timer intended for vehicles.

The hardware consists an Atmel AVR microcontroller connected to a GPS receiver and a 4-line HD44780 LCD, otgether with some buttons for control.

To make it, you need avr-gcc, avr-libc and a linux/posix/cygwin environment. The target device is an ATMega32u2, though any AVR with >= 16k flash, 1k SRAM, UART and Timer1 should work. As this project uses math lib (libm) and printf with support for floats, it needs nearly 16k when compiled.

There is no schematic as the circuit is currently rats' nested.
  Port D Bit 7   : RED button
  Port D Bit 5   : BLACK button
  Port D Bit 3   : Sirf commands to GPS receiver
  PORT D Bit 2   : NMEA data from GPS receiver
  Port D Bit 1   : LCD 'E' pin
  Port D Bit 0   : LCD 'RS' pin
  Port B Bit 7-4 : LCD 'D7' - 'D4' pins
  Port C Bit 1   : Reset button + 10k pull up resistor

All connections are direct.

USB port and decoupling capacitor connected as described in Atmel datasheet.

Power supply must be decoupled.

The commands used to set up the GPS receiver are specific to the Sirf Star III chipset. They are used to minimize the activity on the UART and also enable the $GPVTG NMEA sentences, used in preference to $GPRMC. The expected baud rate is 38k. This is likely to need to be changed to suit any alternate GPS receiver.
