## Summary

The idea:  

each shutter has its own pushbutton (one button for both up and down : stop->up->stop->down->stop->...)  

make a ' time window ' in witch i count the number of keypresses.  

1 keypress : shutter  

2 keypresses : all the shutters in the room  

3 keypresses : all the shutters on the floor  

4 keypresses : all the shutters in the building 


You can also block one shutter so that he will not respond on any command. ( to avoid that someone opened  

my shutter from somewhere else in the house )  

To put a shutter in the blocked mode. Keep the pushbutton down for a time longer than the timewindow. To deblock the shutter  

you have to do the same .
