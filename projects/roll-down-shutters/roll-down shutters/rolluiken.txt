I made this project to control my roll-down shutters in my new build house.
Later on I decided to use an 'old' Siemens 95U  PLC with a lot of I/O cards.
I did some soldering on a prototypeboard that I connected to my STK500.

The idea:
each shutter has its ouwn pushbutton (one button for both up and down : stop->up->stop->down->stop->...)
make a ' time window ' in witch i count the number of keypresses.
1 keypress   :  shutter 
2 keypresses : all the shutters in the room  
3 keypresses : all the shutters on the floor
4 keypresses : all the shutters in the building  

You can also block one shutter so that he will not respond on any command. ( to avoid that someone opened 
my shutter from somewhere else in the house )
To put a shutter in the blocked mode. Keep the pushbutton down for a time longer than the timewindow. To deblock the shutter
you have to do the same .




Now only 14 shutters implemented for memory reasons

STATUS BYTE:
             0    up
             1    down
             2    previous state up
             3    previous state down
             4    blocked
             5    reverse
             6    going up
             7    going down

EEPROM size :  7 x 8 bytes for the user defined characters
               nr_of_shutters  x 20 bytes for the shutter matrix

SRAM   size :  nr_of_shutters  x 20 byters for the shutter matrix




MAX NUMBER OF SHUTTERS ON A   ATMEGA 8535   :  16
                              ATMEGA 16     :  22
                              ATMEGA 32     :  24  ( full usage of the hardware)

                              -> all 3 devices ar pin compatible and available in PDIP packages



INPUTS  : 3 x PCF8574A  ->  24 inputs
OUTPUTS : 6 x PCF8574   ->  48 outputs


NOTE : NON USED OUTPUTS FOR SHUTTERS CAN BE USED FOR OTHER PURPOSES
          ( IMPULS ON/OFF , 2 OUTPUTS UP AND DOWN CONNECTED)




TODO  : change the adresses of the PCF 8574P-AP devices.

                                                  .7    upwards   shutter n+3


 position_def = time needed for roll-down shutter to open en close
 time = position_def * 64 msec      733 * 64msec = 46.912 sec
