## Summary

This is a dual update of the SPWM inverter project (presented on March 2019).


It's 3 pages addendum together with the main document, that describes a


little more higher power stage driving (8kHz instead of 2kHz) - V4


and automatic MSW driving (from 40% to 90%) - V5.


Both .hex filesÂ are included with the document, also there has been the


change of the contact email in the document.
