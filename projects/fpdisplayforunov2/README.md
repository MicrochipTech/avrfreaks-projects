## Summary

This project is a development of the project “Floating point display for UNO (V1)” which I posted on 23 May 2021. 


Rather than using two ATtiny 861 devices to drive the display a single ATtiny1606 is used. Two applications are provided:


 


FP\_display\_V2 is a Studio 7 application, however the hex file is provided so that Studio 7 may not initially be needed.


 


A UNO template is also included which is an Arduino sketch and comes with the subroutines required to drive the 1606


 


For basic background information the reader is referred to version 1 of this project. 


In particular programmers notepad is recommended for viewing template resources that Arduino cannot open.
