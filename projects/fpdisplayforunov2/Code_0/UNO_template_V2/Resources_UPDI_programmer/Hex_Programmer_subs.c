/*
This code is closely based on that used for the UNO AVR programmer however it 
can only be used to down load signle hex files and is therefore rather simpler/ 

Where strings are to be stored AVR hex files consist of two sections.  
The first contains the C code and the second contains the strings.
The second follows the first with no unused address space between them
However the code section does not necessarily end with a comlete record
and the string section always starts on a new record.
Code records therefore always start with addresses 0000, 0x0010,  0x0020, 0x0030 ......
String recods can start with any address.
The hex file is stored in pages and the break between code and strings does not
necessarily occur at a page boundary. 

Some of the original complexity therefore remains.

In addition it was observed that hex files generated with AVR studio for
devices using the UPDI can end in lines of odd length. This occurs for
srings with odd number of characters.  Preiously the compiler added an addditional
null character at the end of the hex file to ensue that all lines have even length
i.e. a whole number of 16 bit words to write to flash.
Without this precaution there was no termination for the final string which 
continues printing indefinitly.
