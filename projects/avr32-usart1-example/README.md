## Summary

This project uses the USART1 on the AT32UC3C-EK to print a string. The code was written for AVR Studio 5. Due to attachment size restrictions, only the source code files are attached. Simply create a new project in AVR Studio 5, choose "Atmel Boards" on the left and UC3C-EK template on the right. Remove the existing main.c and add in the attached files.


Pins 3 & 4 of header J25 (the unlabeled one next to J44) on the AT32UC3C-EK are RX and TX.
