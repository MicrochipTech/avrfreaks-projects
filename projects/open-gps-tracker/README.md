## Summary

The Open GPS Tracker is a small device which plugs into a $20 prepaid mobile phone to make a GPS tracker. The Tracker responds to text message commands, detects motion, and sends you its exact position, ready for Google Maps or your mapping software. The Tracker firmware is open source and user-customizable.


The current supported hardware platform is:


 * Tyco Electronics A1035D GPS module  

 * Motorola C168i AT&T GoPhone prepaid mobile phone  

 * Atmel ATTINY84-20PU AVR microcontroller 


Project requires no interface chips! All you need is a GPS module, a phone, an ATTINY84, a voltage regulator, a PNP transistor, and a few passive components. This is a commercial grade tracker and is currently a second-generation stable version V0.17A.


This version stores messages while out of GSM coverage, and forwards them when it regains coverage.


If you are building a tracker, please post on the forum at my website.
