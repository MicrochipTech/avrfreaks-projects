# SNAP protocol lib

## Summary

This archive contains a nearly full implementation of the S.N.A.P protocol from HTH for avr-gcc. I've used this in my own home automation project but I've switched to my own protocol so this code may no longer be maintained. I release it to public in the hope that this code is somewhat useful to others.
