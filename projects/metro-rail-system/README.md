## Summary

We are living in the Embedded World. We are surrounded with many embedded products and our daily life largely depends on the proper functioning of these gadgets.Television, Radio, CD player, Washing Machine or Microwave Oven in our kitchen,Card readers, Palm devices of our work space enable us to do many of our tasks very effectively. All kinds of magazines and journals regularly dish out details about latest technologies, new devices; fast applications which make us believe that our basic survival is controlled by these embedded products. Now we can agree to the fact that these embedded products have successfully invaded into our world.  

This is how my project works:  

When the power is turned on lcd display is switched on and a message (â€œwelcome to chandigarh metroâ€) is displayed on LCD. Then a message â€œEnter ticket numberâ€ is displayed. The ticket no. is checked whether it is correct or not. If it is incorrect the messageâ€Incorrect Ticketâ€ is displayed and it again asks for the correct ticket number. If the ticket is correct then it displays the message â€œCorrect Ticket, Enjoy Journeyâ€. LED glows and name of current stationâ€Sector 17â€ is diplayed on the lcd. Then the train starts moving from one station to another. As the train is about to reache the next station it displays the message â€Reaching next stationâ€ and buzzer is activated. As soon as the train reaches the next station and the train comes to a halt the message â€œ(name of the station)â€ is shown on d LCD and LED glows. When the train comes to a halt buzzer and the corresponding led is activated.This process continues till the train reaches its final destination and the message â€œENDâ€ is shown on the screen.
