## Summary

I wrote this example using the AT32UC3C-EK development board, but there isn't any board specific code to keep it portable.


The example blinks an LED using a for loop as a delay while changing the clocks and prescaling. This shows the flexibility provided by dynamic prescaling and clock selection.
