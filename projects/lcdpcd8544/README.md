## Summary

Implementation with seperate graph (line/circle) routines and text routines that can be compiled in or left out. Includes routines for scrolling and copying in small arbitrary-sized bitmaps to arbitrary places on screen, and inverse characters/bitmaps. A little larger than NokiaLCD but adds some functionality.
