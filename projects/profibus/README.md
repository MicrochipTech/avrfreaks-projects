## Summary

To run Profibus at full 12MB speed with an AVR, an external ASIC is required.  

This project uses the VPC3+C chip to interface the micro to the Bus.


Included is the c code for interfacing the VPC3 to a 8051, and the first makings of the AVR project.  

Please note, if you are planning on using this code for commercial purpose, please contact me.


If you are capable of completing the port to AVR, please contact me.


Edit:.......  

This code has been downloaded and used in quit a few "commercial" projects with much success now, however, none of these people have posted any code back to this site.


Please be considerate of the assistance you get from this site, post back to help others :)
