## Summary

The Freescale MC33186 chip provides a full H-Bridge motor driver on a single chip. It has two control lines that can be used to control direction and speed. Other (optional) lines provide output enable and fault detection.  

By connecting these two lines directly to two counter/PWM outputs on an AVR, a ridiculously simple but full featured DC motor speed controller can be built.
