***Hi there,***



***Does anybody knows any freeware or any other simple way to convert an audio (.wav) file to Octal data ?  

I'd like to convert a simple .wav file, actually I need a c++ program that will read a WAV file and produces a text or excel file with Octal data.   

The link below shows how to make a c++ program that can do that.:
