## Summary

This device connects to ATARI ST's ACSI port and acts as if the SD/MMC card were a regular ATARI hard-drive.


What it does:


- communication with SD/MMC card using SPI interface (using the Procyon AVRlib by Pascal Stang)


- communicates with ATARI ST through the ACSI port - ATARI specific HW protocol, the SW protocol is standart SCSI-2


- the ATmega16 communicates with ATARI ST through XILINX XC9536XL CPLD which helps it with the right timing and data latching
