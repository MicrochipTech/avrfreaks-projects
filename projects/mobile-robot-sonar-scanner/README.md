## Summary

Robot uses stepper motor to rotate the sonar sensor and it covers 180 degree. Each 45 degree, a sample is taken. There is a LED display which works like radar, and shows the detected obstacles.  

Moreover, Robot can switch to remote control mode. So,we can simply control the motion and get samples using RF transmitter.
