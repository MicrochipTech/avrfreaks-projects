## Summary

In everyday practice, ham often there are situations when you need to quickly assess stress at certain points in some circuits, the presence and frequency of the pulse, logic level, etc. - it is estimated rather than measured. As a general rule, it is required for a quick check " defective, faulty "some node apparatus, etc. Generally used for this purpose an ordinary meter, but on the one hand, not every multimeter can, for example, to measure the frequency of a wide range, but on the other hand - almost one meter is too large size and capacity to read the transactions in question. 


I think there can help a special probe, which features more than enough in many cases eliminate the use of a multimeter, and some cases - even an oscilloscope, while its dimensions are commensurate with a thick marker stationery.
