## Summary

This project uses Timer1 in CTC mode in Atmega32. 


Connections:


LED1----> PORTB.0  

LED2----> PORTB.1  

LED3----> PORTB.2  

Vcc-----> +5V  

RESET---> +5V through 10k resistor  

GND-----> Ground of the power supply


Extensions:


This project simply gives insights into using timer in CTC mode. So any pattern can be generated by minor modifications in the code. Any number  

LEDs can be connected.
