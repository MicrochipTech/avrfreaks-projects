## Summary

Students in ECE 4760 at Cornell University were given the responsibility of choosing, designing and building a project using Atmel Mega644 microcontrollers. Over 30 projects this year include a3D mouse, Haptic appointment manager, fart detector, tissue impedance biopsy system and several interesting musical instruments. This year the coding was done using WINAVR GCC and AVRstudio. There are over 300 projects on the page.
