# Older Pinball Sound Boost

## Summary

I bought an old Gottlieb System 1 pinball machine, Solar Ride.  

This game gives "beeps" of different pitch for scoring 10,100,1000 points. That's it.  

So, by using an arduino one with adafruit wav shield, my pinball machine now can talk!  

By connecting the 5 analog I/O inputs to selected pinball driver board playfield lamps,I can play any wav file during gameplay. Also, the arduino is powered up at game start, so I can give a starting sound.  

So my Solar Ride (1977) plays a horse neigh (see pinball art ) at start-up, then plays different drum loops ( some mixed with a horse neigh) during playing.  

Software from Adafruit was well documented, I had my first proto up'n running in about a week.  

Update:  

Forgot to mention that the wav files must be a specific type ( see doc from Adafruit ), easiest tool to make them are sound exchange ( <http://sox.sourceforge.net/> )
