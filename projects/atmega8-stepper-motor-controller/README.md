## Summary

A LCD diaplay and RPG hooked to a maga8. The mega8 controls the X & Y plus and minus field coils. The simple LCD user interface allow the user to control the phase with the rotation of the rotary pulse generator or with different velocities. The ADC monitors the total field coil current on the stepper motor. 


Pretty worthless project.
