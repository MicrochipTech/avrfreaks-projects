## Summary

This is something I felt like doing on my spare time. its a custom VFD that was made for compact stereos, but was actually never employed. several are still remaining on VFD. So i made a controller circuit that is compatible with the T23A commandset. 


used a PC parallel port and a PC program to communicate. works with LCD hype. you can also adapt this for other stuff, such as your own atmel to do FFT and using this to print out your FFT. 


but i was using a PC with winamp for the FFT.
