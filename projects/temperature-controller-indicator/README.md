## Summary

A very simple room temperature monitor and controller can be built around  

AT90S4433 8-bit RISC micro-controller. Temperature sensor’s data is  

processed by the micro-controller and depending upon temperature range, a  

cooling/heating appliance can be switched ON or OFF. Temperature sensor  

MAX6577 used in the circuit, is capable of measuring temperature in range  

of –40ºC to +125ºC and practically requires no other external component for  

the purpose. This sensor converts the temperature into a square wave with  

output signal frequency proportional to absolute temperature. AVR  

micro-controller AT90S4433 is used for processing the sensor data,  

monitoring and controlling the temperature. The tempearture range can be set  

with help of the provide pushbuttons. Monitored temperature and settings  

details are displayed on LED Display Unit
