## Summary

This code calculates the relative (X,Y) position based on (1) a direction or heading and (2) motion,expressed in the form of wheel displacement. A second routine calculates the direction and the distance to a gridpoint that was specified as the target.  

It depends partly on the division/multiplication routines as presented in Atmels appnote 200 although I made minor modifications to them to suit the requirements of this program. 


Please read the comments in the .asm file for more information.
