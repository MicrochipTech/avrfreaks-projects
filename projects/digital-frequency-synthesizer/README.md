## Summary

Digital Frequency Synthesizer with LCD display and rotary dial frequency control, using an inexpensive AD9850 board (<$6) and an Atmega8. The rotary encoder changes the frequency (from 0 to 50 MHz or more). Pressing the button on the encoder (an equally inexpensive 5-terminal cheapie) changes the step size of the frequency knob from 1Hz to 100KHz. Uses Atmega8's internal 8MHz clock. The schematic is a little vague about connections to the AD9850 module and the LCD, but the source files should make pinouts clear.
