## Summary

LIS302DL is a little 3 axis accelerometer with digital interface capability.This project just reads the values from 3 axes and displays it via any Terminal program through serial port.  

Interfacing is simple.LIS302DL has an SPI interface which can connect directly to ATMega48 PortB Pin2 is used as Chip select line on mega48.  

LIS302DL runs at 3.3 volts so the whole circuit has to operate on 3.3V  

ATMega 48 is running at 8 MHz internal clock..


Any questions ,send me a message through AVRFreaks and I will try to answer.
