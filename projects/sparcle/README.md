## Summary

Light regulator experiment with RS232 communication capabilities.


It is derived from my diploma work (OPEN SOURCE DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT FOR AVR BUTTERFLY) at Faculty of Electrical Engineering and computer science (FERI), University of Maribor (UM), Slovenia.


The code is under BSD Licence.


The program is originally written for the AVR Butterfly development board, but it is also possible to compile it for ATmega16 just by changing the makefile.


It includes a simple "p" regulation loop and a open loop regulator. It is also capable to communicate with a computer via the RS232 interface. You can use any terminal emulator to control it.


The file includes also some documentation.


Please, let me know if you will find this code usefull.
