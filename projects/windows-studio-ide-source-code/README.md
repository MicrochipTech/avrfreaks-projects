## Summary

Happy Christmas 2008 AVR Community  

If you can compile windows C++ code, we have just released the source code for STUDIO+ which was launched 8 years ago on here and had over 10,000 downloads... it is the cheapest and fastest way of debugging AVR code without having to buy any AVR tools.. so students should love it. I have added sample schematics and ISD code for AVR mega 8 so you can see how to connect up to your board from a PC's RS232 port.  

It will run ok under all versions of Windows except for VISTA, maybe an installer problem, if anyone finds the problem let me know.. Thanks


Were now on the 10th Anniversary of when we entered the AVR tools market, we are pleased to announce the release of the windows source code for STUDIO+ to the AVR community. If Atmel was willing they could have put this into STUDIO IDE 8 years ago, but seems like they wanted to just sell you hardware tools.. shame that, the one thing that was missing from ATMEL STUDIO was a decent In-System-Debugger.. Simulation is never as good. 


8 years ago only two basic ISD's were required.. one for the Mega and one for non-mega. You then just customized the ISD code by saying how much SRAM, EEPROM your chip has.., re-assemble and then include it with your AVR program you want to debug, it is really easy once you have done it a few times.  

You can even run the ISD code and use a Terminal Emulator program to display results back from the AVR, but much better if you can get STUDIO+ working.. it has some amazing features like CHIP-VIEW which lets you see the status of individual PORT I/O pins and stack view, you can debug in near-real-time using snapshot mode... and change memory locations on-the-fly  

Have fun, you will need to remove the silkandersoft protection code and redo the windows installer, I am unable to answer any individual technical questions but may monitor my forum post/announcment.

I have removed one C++ source code file supporting Imagecraft C compiler.. guess Richard will have to offer me something to put that in..


Thanks
