## Summary

Mara is a programming language dedicated to 8bit ATMEL AVR microcontrollers with a focus on simplicity and productivity.  

It provides to AVR architecture some features that high-level programming languages have introduced on 32/64 bits processors, such as classes and type inference.  

Thus, the goal of this project is to simplify the programming of these microcontrollers for all those who do not wish to use (or learn) the C or assembly language.


Some features of Mara :  

 - Simple and structured syntax  

 - Type inference  

 - Classes and objects  

 - Explicit error messages  

 - Standard library containing usual data structures  

 - Inline assembler  

 - Finite-state machines
