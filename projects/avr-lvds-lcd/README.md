## Summary

Yep! It's possible!


Scale back your high expectations just a little bit, and realize that quite a bit can be done with an old laptop's TFT. (LVDS/FPD-Link, or TTL).


512 bytes of RAM gives images of 341x768 at 48 colors... on a 1024x768 display. Steady image with 1Hz refresh. What more can I say?


Check out the main code-page at:

(The "Add File" link, and in fact the majority of this site, is not functioning for me. What, Safari on a PPC is too old for yah?! Anyways, there'll be more regular updates at the link above.)
