/// \par Overview
///		This library provides the high-level functions needed to use the I2C
///	serial interface supported by the hardware of several AVR processors.
/// The library is functional but has not been exhaustively tested yet and is
/// still expanding.  Thanks to the standardization of the I2C protocol and
///	register access, the send and receive commands are everything you need to
/// talk to thousands of different I2C devices including: EEPROMS, Flash memory,
/// MP3 players, A/D and D/A converters, electronic potentiometers, etc.
///
/// \par About I2C
///			I2C (pronounced "eye-squared-see") is a two-wire bidirectional
///		network designed for easy transfer of information between a wide variety
///		of intelligent devices.  Many of the Atmel AVR series processors have
///		hardware support for transmitting and receiving using an I2C-type bus.
///		In addition to the AVRs, there are thousands of other parts made by
///		manufacturers like Philips, Maxim, National, TI, etc that use I2C as
///		their primary means of communication and control.  Common device types
///		are A/D & D/A converters, temp sensors, intelligent battery monitors,
///		MP3 decoder chips, EEPROM chips, multiplexing switches, etc.
///
///		I2C uses only two wires (SDA and SCL) to communicate bidirectionally
///		between devices.  I2C is a multidrop network, meaning that you can have
///		several devices on a single bus.  Because I2C uses a 7-bit number to
///		identify which device it wants to talk to, you cannot have more than
///		127 devices on a single bus.
///
///		I2C ordinarily requires two 4.7K pull-up resistors to power (one each on
///		SDA and SCL), but for small numbers of devices (maybe 1-4), it is enough
///		to activate the internal pull-up resistors in the AVR processor.  To do
///		this, set the port pins, which correspond to the I2C pins SDA/SCL, high.
///		For example, on the mega163, sbi(PORTC, 0); sbi(PORTC, 1);.
///
///		For complete information about I2C, see the Philips Semiconductor
///		website.  They created I2C and have the largest family of devices that
///		work with I2C.
///
/// \Note: Many manufacturers market I2C bus devices under a different or generic
///		bus name like "Two-Wire Interface".  This is because Philips still holds
///		"I2C" as a trademark.  For example, SMBus and SMBus devices are hardware
///		compatible and closely related to I2C.  They can be directly connected
///		to an I2C bus along with other I2C devices are are generally accessed in
///		the same way as I2C devices.  SMBus is often found on modern motherboards
///		for temp sensing and other low-level control tasks.
