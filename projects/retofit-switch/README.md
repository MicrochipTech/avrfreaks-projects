## Summary

This project consist of avr studio code written on winavr gcc compilier.  

There is also a simulation file design using Proteus.


The concept of these example is reading analog input from solar panel and give the first priority to solar panel and take decision to switch on the power source connected to main grid and solar panel. If solar is below the threshold then the switch is normally open and make the connection to main supply. when solar become above the threshold then the switch is connected to solar source by default.


These project will give solution to switching solar and main grid.


Happy programming....
