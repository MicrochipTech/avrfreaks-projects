## Summary

Dear freaks,


A long time ago I wanted to implement usb communication with


optocouplers for my uC's projects.


Â 


I upload two different designs in eagle files.


One uses H11L1 optocouplers but the design can achieve only up to 83.3 kbps transfer rates.


The second one uses 6N137 optocouplers and I have achieved 1Mbps transfer rates.


The latter was realized using oshpark and you can find it on the following link

I hope it shall be helpful.
