## Summary

In opposition to others, this bootloader has almost no influence to the user application, since it was completely silent until the magic word was received. Only the reset time was expanded of about 0.2sec.  

Furthermore the PC software was very easy to use, no awkward program must be started and no many mouse clicks are needed. Its a small command line tool, which can easy be called from the make file or the compile batch.  

All sources available so it shoud be possible to compile the PC tool also under Linux.  

The description was included in English (index.htm) and German (indexg.htm).
