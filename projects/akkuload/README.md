## Summary

AkkuLoad loads up to four single accu cells with predefined currents between 5 mA and 220 mA (max. up to 350 mA in a single channel). The characteristics and all necessary parameters are selectable for each of the four channels separatly, so that mixed loading of different cells is possible with no limitations. The load characteristics are preselected, the microprocessor measures and controls currents and capacities. The  

control over the loader can either take place with a serial RS232 interface and a terminal program like Hyperterminal or by three keys.  

Output and control uses a 4-line-LCD.  

The characteristica and the load history of up to 32 accumulators are storable internally, so that the necessary parameters (load capacity, currents, etc.) can be selected very quick. The number of full loads with nominal capacity is stored and automatically updated each time a load ends.  

Using the RS232 interface, all informations are readable and all functions can be performed. By using the monitoring mode all measured values are traced and can be copied to a textfile. These values can be used to display the load characteristics via PC software.
