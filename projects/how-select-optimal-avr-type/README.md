## Summary

Hi freaks,


I wrote an article on <a href="[http://www.avr-asm-tutorial.net/...](http://www.avr-asm-tutorial.net/avr_en/how-to/typeselect/typeselect.html)">how to select the optimal AVR type for your hardware needs</a>.

Arduino-Freaks: You don't have to read this, because your answer might always be ATmega328. All others might enjoy this.


 


best regards,


Gerhard
