## Summary

The circuit is based on an ATtiny13V and requires just a few components. It uses a 3v lithium battery to power up before it generates its own supply voltage. The AVR measures the current battery voltage and computes the appropriate PWM signal for the step-up converter. 


This circuit can be used in headlamps, flashlights or bicycle lamps an really empies your batteries as it still runs on very low supply voltages.
