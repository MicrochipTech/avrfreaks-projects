## Summary

This is my first AVR project ever, so it might not be the most beautiful but it works. This clock displays minutes and hours in binary. It has an alarm function that drives a piezo.


This clock contains an AVR ATmega8 clocked by a 32,768 crystal. There are 11 leds to display time and 1 led to show seconds counting.


The time can't be set by buttons yet but has to be progged in ASM.
