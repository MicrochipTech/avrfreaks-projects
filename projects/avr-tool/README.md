# AVR-Tool

## Summary

My Tool retrieves some Information from files installed together with AVR-Studio (wich has to be installed to run my tool). You can search for information of the IO-Modules from your AVR-CPU. Also all available Bits and bytes are easily available. And it gives a little help in writing C-Code by documenting IO-Register Access (use your Clipboard). There is no documentation and no warranty at all. Use at your own risk. 


My english is bad! Sorry, but i am no native speaker.


Please give me feedback via PN.


Have Fun
