## Summary

I designed this little board some time ago. It's mostly surface-mount, and has a small prototyping area. The RS-232 interface is optional, and is enabled by two wire links. To save space, I used a 3-way Molex connector for it. All the I/O pins are brought out to pads. It has a standard 6-way connector for ISP, and debugging using the Dragon and debugWIRE. It includes a 100 mA regulator.
