YALBlinkie


Yet Another LED Blinkie project


I wanted to play with a simple RGB LED, to see how colors would mix, change and stuff. So I build my own LED and "controller". It fades in and out a set of 9 LEDs (3 RGB LEDs) into random values. See the video here: 


It's just a nice little decorational thingie I made to amuse myself. I plan on installing it either into some plant pot - to make the plant look really interesting. Oh, and my "LEDs" are waterproof.
