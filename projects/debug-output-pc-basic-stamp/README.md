## Summary

When running AVR's from internal oscillators, if you happen to have a basic stamp (I know many people that work with Atmel chips started with basic stamps) Allows you to send bytes of data to the basic stamp and format the output to the PC screen via serial commands built into the basic stamp.'


Quick and dirty but it works great.
