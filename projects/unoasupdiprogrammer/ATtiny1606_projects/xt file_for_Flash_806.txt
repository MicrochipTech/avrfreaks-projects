The UPDI inteface:	Defines the way that many new AVR devices are to be programmered via the reset pin.

For default settings the reset pin is connected to a single pin UART that can be switched between an input and output. 

This program is a UNO project that enables Attiny 808/1606 chips to be programmed using the UPDI protocol.

The SOIC footprint is ideal for anyone wishing to migrate to SM designs, (but make sure that plenty of copper is available for the soldering iron.  Commercial footprints may need adjusting.)

Both hex and text files can be programmed to flash.  The Attiny 806 has 8kBytes of flash and one has been reseved for text.

For demonstration purposes a target device is permanently connected to a UNO.  Initially the UNO programms the 1606 with sample hex and text files.  The hex reads the text or performs some simple arithmetic.

The sample programs include timer TCA, the watchdog timer and UART with separate Rx and Tx lines, which are common requirements.
