## Summary

This is a projects that has been long in the making. For those of you who may have the book "Musical Application of Microprocessors" by Hal Chamberlin, you will probably recognize the hardware architecture...although, because it is in an FPGA rather than being built with discrete TTL chips, it is much bigger.


Currently, it implements 512 oscillators, 512 ADSR envelope generators and 512 gain controlled amplifiers, all controlled by an ATmega2561 micro controller.


It is implemented using a Spartan 3 Starter board from Digilent, an STK500/501 combo by Atmel, and a couple of homemade boards by myself. For now, I am going to just provide a link to my project webpage where you can download a zip file containing everything I have for the project. The file is about 28 Mega bytes.
