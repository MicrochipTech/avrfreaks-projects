ATMEGA8Restore2FactoryDefault

shortdesc:
Factory Default to the Atmega8 when you can't access to the chip.

Do you have these problems(questions) on your ATMEGA8?

Why I am unable to program/read ATMEGA8 nevermore?
Why the RESET pin does not work?
How can I unprogram RSTDISB fuse bit?
How can I change External crystal fuse bits to internal RC oscillator?
How can I change External Resonator fuse bits to internal RC oscillator?
How can I change External RC oscillator fuse bits to internal RC oscillator?
Is there a way to came back ATMega8 fuse bits to factory default?

It happened when you program RSTDISBL fuse bit, select External Crystal or External RC oscillator. At this condition, programming and reading maybe not possible.

To fix the problem you need this hardware.

How does it work?
It program all fuse bits & lock bits to the ATMEGA8_FACTORY_DEFAULT, and the flash memory (code area) will be erased.
Briefly parallel programming can fix the problem.
