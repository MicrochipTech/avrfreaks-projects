## Summary

This circuit has been designed as a small control center for a caravan. It actually measure voltage, current and temperature (internal atmega88P sensor) and displays the measured vaules in a 16x2 LCD display. Other 4 ADC inputs are available for further FW implementations. Also, the FW implements a settable clock. An additional HW RTC keep the time to be non volatile. A momentary push button power on the circuit. If no button is pressed, the microcontroller itself keep the circuit active for a minute, then auto-power off to avoid any caravan battery consumption.
