# OrCAD and Protel99SE AVR Library

Uploaded by wsw on 2005-03-07 22:07:00 (rating 0 out of 5)

## Summary

A free schematics library for OrCAD 9.x which contains lots of AVR parts.  

The Protel99SE library was generated from the OrCAD lib.  

(Seems Protel doesn't know the zero legth pins I used for the DNCs of the 3290/6490.)


Please see the "List of Parts" for the devices contained in the library.


Please let me also know if you find an error or have something to add!!


Enjoy,  

Stefan Wimmer
