Converter from UART (38400 baud) to Midi (31250 baud) (bidirectional).

In conjunction with a FT232RL USB-to-serial converter you get a 
full-duplex MIDI-interface for USB. There is no layout at the moment as
I build it only on a breakboard. If you do a layout please drop me a mail.
You can replace the FT232-ciruit with a circuit around a MAX232 to get
a MIDI-interface from RS232.

There is no additional protocol inside my converter, all data will simply
be transmitted 1:1 from 38400 baud to 31250 baud and vice versa. 
In the direction from 38400 baud to 31250 baud there is a fifo implemented
in the converter. The LEDs shows how full the fifo is, red indicates that
midi-data has been dropped due to fifo-overflow.

There are a few windows-drivers from manufacturers like Roland, Yamaha or Kawai which 
can be used with this interface. I prefered the "Roland Serial MIDI Driver Ver.3.2 for
Windows XP / Windows 2000". I found it at www.roland.com when searching for "SK-500". 
You can also try to use the "Yamaha CBX Driver" (ask your favourite search engine), 
but it didn't worked for me. If you use the FT232 make sure to install the 
FT232-USB-driver first. Make sure that it work (using Hyperterm or whatever at 
38400 baud, 8N1 and get the MIDI-codes from a keyboard attached to MIDI-In) before
you install the MIDI-driver.

Good luck.
