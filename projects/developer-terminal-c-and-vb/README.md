## Summary

**PLEASE NOTE THAT THERE IS AN ON-GOING DISCUSSION OF THIS IN THE TUTORIAL SECTION. BUGS WILL BE FOUND AND CORRECTIONS WILL BE POSTED THERE AND HERE - SO WAIT A WHILE BEFORE ACCEPTING THIS AS A FINAL VERSION OF THIS PROJECT.**


2/17/08 Change encoding to bytes by adding this line just after the MainForm class heading:  

 // JWP 2/17/08 Set encoding to 8 bits - was ASCII  

 serialPort1.Encoding = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8;


4/28/07 Beta Revision 0.02 fixes a byte reception bug.  




As promised a long time ago, I am posting a Developer Terminal and source code in C# and Visual Basic (both 2005 Express versions) and two draft chapters from a forthcoming as yet untitled book:  

'Developer Terminal Manual.pdf'  

'Modem Line Experiments.pdf'


All materials in this directory are draft and beta releases.I would very much appreciate any feedback, especially on typos and program bugs.


Please send all comments and concerns to joe[!]smileyMicros.com with the [!] replaced by @  

No PMs on this please.


The free C# and Visual Basic 2005 Express editions are available at: ([http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudi...](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express)) and provide an easy (relatively) way to create a PC side GUI (Graphical User Interface) for serial communication with a microcontroller.


I think that this would be a good way for someone interested in microcontrollers to learn to create PC GUIs and I'm willing to provide help (either on this thread or via emails) to anyone who wants to read the chapters and work through the materials to build the C# programs. In return all I ask is some feedback, especially looking for typos, stupidos, and what-tha-fuuu-os.
