## Summary

After a day's research and a lot of not working CRC32 implementations I finally have some working code.  

There is a version with and without lookup table. The tabled version needs 1k ram during calculation, but is much faster.  

These functions are very simple and should work with any compiler.

## Compilers

- WinAVR (GNU GCC)
