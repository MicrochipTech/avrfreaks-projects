## Summary

ArdOS is a real-time operating system targeted at Arduino and other applications utilizing the ATmega168/328/1280 and 2560 microcontrollers. ArdOS features:


- A tight compact kernel with a maximum footprint of under 2k of flash and under 200 bytes of RAM.


- Parts of the operating system can be left out to conserve memory.


- Configurable calling-stack sizes for individual tasks.


- A choice of a co-operative scheduler or a priority-based pre-emptive scheduler for hard real-time systems.


- A sleep function that frees the microcontroller for other tasks. No more busy-wait loops!


- Binary and counting semaphores.


- First-in-first-out and prioritized message queues.


- Mutex locks and conditional variables.
