# VCR drum display

## Summary

Every VHS video cassette recorder contains a shiny video head drum of about 6 cm across, which is easily removed from a VCR thatâ€™s no longer of use, but not so easy to reuse for something else. It is a three phase stepper motor which requires some specials electronics to make it go at the desired speed. To make matters worse, in order to get it going, it must initially be given a slow frequency, which can slowly be increased in order to speed it up.


What I write here, in essence is also true for the motor that can be salvaged from an old hard disk. Itâ€™s smaller and a bit harder to take out, but it works using the same driver circuit. 


In this project we'll get the VCR drum running as well as the hard disk motor. There are plenty of research data, diagrams, electronic circuits, example AVR programs, photos, scope images of wave forms and finally a film of the fun part on [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1vlRsye_Gc)
