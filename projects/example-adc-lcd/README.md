## Summary

In this project the input pin is adc 0, PC0, here the adc count is recorded and display the count. after the count you can calculate using the formula


ADC = ADC\_Count/1023.0*5;  

here 1023 is 10bit resolution;  

 5---> is Vref


The Hardware Simulation is done using Proteus Professional;


The LCD code has written for 4bit data mode , Data and Control bit arise from Same PORTB.


Happy Programming
