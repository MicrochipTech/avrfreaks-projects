## Summary

This project is a replacement controller for a Skeeball model H series game. The new controller is based on an Atmega8 controller and features sound generation based on RTTTL ringtones, control of high and low voltage lamps/outputs and generally keeping state to make the game playable. It is a fully functional replacement for the original control board and adds scrolling text displays and customized game sounds sampled from classic arcade games. Check out my website for complete hardware details (schematic, board, parts list) and code.
