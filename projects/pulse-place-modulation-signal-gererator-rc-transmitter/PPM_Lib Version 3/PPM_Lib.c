//------[ INTRODUCTION ]------------------------------------------------------------
//
//If you want to build your own RC transmitter then using a commercial HF module
//such as the Graupner/JR Sender-HF-Modul Part Nr 4057 or the Graupner/JR
//PLL-SYNTHESIZER-Sender HF-Modul Part Nr 4059 is a good idea.
//Using such a module you will not have to worry about a transmitter license nor
//will you have to worry about building the HF-portion of the transmitter.
//
//I can buy such a module for about 75 Euro. If somebody can tell me where I can buy
//a comparable module for less please send me a mail jan.huygh@skynet.be
//
//This program does generate the postitive Pulse Position Modulation (PPM) signal
//that you will need if you want to build your own RC transmitter using such a
//commercial High Frequency module. These Modules take a PPM signal as input.
//
//If you have a Graupner X-756 or comparable transmitter then the trainer signal is
//this PPM-signal. So you could use the trainer connection on that transmitter and
//avoid buying the above mentioned module.
//
//------[ DESCRIPTION OF THE POSITIVE PPM SIGNAL ]----------------------------------
//
//The PPM signal is transmitted every 20 ms. Between 2 PPM signals the line is high.
//The start of the PPM signal is a line low pulse of 0,4 ms.
//After this start-pulse each channel is transmitted by setting the line high for
//x ms followed by a low pulse of y ms with y at least 0,4 ms.
//On the receiver this will generate a pulse with a lenght of x + y ms.
//The receiver expects each channel pulse to be between 1 and 2 ms.
//
//To transmit 8 channels you need 8 X 2 + 0,4 ms = 16,4 ms
//
//--------[ CONNECTING TO A HF MODULE ]---------------------------------------------
//
//  |                    If you lay the HF module in front of you with the
//  |                    connector (5 small holes) in the lower left corner
//  |   PPM             then the connections are as indicated here on the left.
//  |   +5V
//  |   +8V                PPM is the Positive Pulse Position Signal
//  |   GND                + 5V is a stabelized 5V tention
//  |   To Antenna         + 8V to this you connect your main battery
//  |______________            8 * 1.5 = 12V is OK too.
//                          GND is the ground connection (the - from the battery)
//
//------[ EXPLAINING HOW THIS CODE WORKS ]------------------------------------------
//
//The transmitter has to transmit the PPM signal every 20 ms. The PPM signal can
//take up to 16.4 ms to transmit. This means that the microcontroller in the
//transmitter could spend up to 16.4/20*100% = 82% of his time on generating the
//PPM signal. Obviously that is NOT acceptable. The PPM signal will have to be
//generated using a timer and his interrupt.
//
//The most logical approach would be to use 2 timers : one to time the start of each
//PPM-pulse sequence and a 2nd timer to generate the pulses inside the PPM signal.
//Because we want to leave a maximum of resources available to the microcontroller
//this code will only use one 8 bit timer.
//To make sure this code can be used, even if the microcontroller has already an
//8 bit counter in use, you can set the timer counter that will be used in the
//beginning the code.
//
//Because we use just one timer we will have to set the timer at the end of the
//PPM-signal to that value that generates an interrupt 20ms after the start of the
//PPM signal.
//If all the channel pulses are just 1 ms long, the longest period that we will have
//to set here is 20 - 8X1 - 0,4 = 11,6 ms.
//To time 11.6 ms with the highest precision the best time base would be 11,6/255 =
//0,04549 ms. We can change the time base of the timer using the pre scaler (PS).
//The ideal PS with our microcontroller running at 16 Mhz would be PS = 0,04549 X 16
//X 10^3 = 727,8. The only PS-values that are available are 8, 64, 256 or 1024. So
//we have to use 1024. Using PS = 1024 will set the time base for our counter to
//1024/16 = 64 탎.
//
//The longest pulse we need to generate inside a PPM signal is the channel pulse of
//maximum 2 ms. If we start the high pulse with a fixed 0,5 ms pulse and we end the
//pulse with a 0,5 ms low pulse, the longest pulse we need to transmit is 1 ms.
//Analog to what has been calculated here above : 
//Ideal time base = 1/255 = 0.003921 ms. Ideal PS = 0.003921 X 16 X 10^3 = 62,7.
//That means we will use PS= 64 and so the time base will be 64/16 = 4 탎.
//To generate a 1 ms delay we will have to set the timer to 1000/4 = 250.

//To use this program you need to load PPM_Channel_n_PulseLength [n] with a value
//between 0 and 255. Loading 0 => 1/0ms, Loading 125 => 1.5ms Loading 250 => 2.0ms.
//
//After the initial load of PPM_Channel_n_PulseLength [n] you need to start the PPM-
//pulse-train with the function PPM_Start().
//Your program can now do whatever it needs to do including changing the values for
//PPM_Channel_n_PulseLength [n].
//
//You can stop the PPM signal with the function PPM_Stop().
