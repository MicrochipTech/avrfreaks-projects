# Pulse Place Modulation signal gererator for RC transmitter

## Summary

If you want to build your own RC transmitter then using a commercial HF module  

such as the Graupner/JR Sender-HF-Modul Part Nr 4057 or the Graupner/JR  

PLL-SYNTHESIZER-Sender HF-Modul Part Nr 4059 is a good idea.  

Using such a module you will not have to worry about a transmitter license nor  

will you have to worry about building the HF-portion of the transmitter.


I can buy such a module for about 75 Euro. If somebody can tell me where I can buy a comparable module for less please send me a mail [jan.huygh@skynet.be](mailto:jan.huygh@skynet.be)


This program does generate the postitive Pulse Position Modulation (PPM) signal that you will need if you want to build your own RC transmitter using such a commercial High Frequency module. These Modules take a PPM signal as input.


If you have a Graupner X-756 or comparable transmitter then the trainer signal is this PPM-signal. So you could use the trainer connection on that transmitter and avoid buying the above mentioned module.


The C code is recent... the basic code is an older program but it is a complete trasmitter program (not just the PPM routine)
