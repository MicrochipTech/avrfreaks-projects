# Noname Toaster mod with attiny15

## Summary

This is a modification on my noname toasters 4060 based controller.


I did not like the design flaws of it having problems if I change the burn time after the toaster was started. Sometimes it never stopped, and burned the toast.  

I am also a big fan of indicators, and would like some feedback of how long time it is from releasing the toast. Ultimately I would like a 7-seg display for this, but the powersupply on the design will not work if we use too much current (It will not lock the el-magnet to hold the springs down and start the heater).  

So a single LED was used, and works pretty ok.


I could have made a separate PSU unit, but the space inside the toaster is limited and the Toaster itself did not cost that much, so I just used parts I already had.
