## Summary

This is the original submission to Circuit Cellar for an article that appeared in the September, 2009 issue. The version that was published was edited from this version.


This is a Butterfly based timer that can be set from 1 to 8 minutes in one minute intervals, and can be used for timing the quiet period for rowdy kids. It includes general tone making ("music") code, although it is not fully utilized in the project.


Its main purpose is to introduce some methods for doing general timing as a software technique. It is based on an event manager which makes calls to functions at a specified time in the future, and which can be adapted to a variety of other applications.


The code includes the C source and header files for the ImageCraft version 7 (disregard the V6 in the heading above) compiler, plus the text of the article prior to editing as a pdf file.
