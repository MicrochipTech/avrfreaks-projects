## Summary

**Chiptune Player**


 


Sound Distorter is a chiptune synth, based on the Atmega168. It runs two threads - a generator thread that computes stereo samples at 32 kHz and a sequencer thread that processes the song events at 100 Hz. The synth has a basic menu-based UI in the form of a display, a slider and buttons. Schematics, code and detailed explanation are available [here](http://rdimitrov.info/blog/show.php?entry=Sound%20Distorter).


 


**Monophonic Synthesizer**


 


Same HW, running as a monophonic MIDI synthesizer: [here](http://rdimitrov.info/blog/show.php?entry=Monosynth).
