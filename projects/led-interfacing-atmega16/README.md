## Summary

A LED is an acronym for Light Emitting Diode and is basically an electronic device which emits light when an electric current flows through it. Light-emitting diodes are used in applications as diverse as aviation lighting, automotive lighting, advertising, general lighting and traffic signals. LEDs have allowed new text, video displays, and sensors to be developed, while their high switching rates are also useful in advanced communications technology.


In this project, we will learn How to interface a LED with AVR ATmega16 microcontroller. We will connect a LED with AVR ATmega16 microcontroller and we will glow the LED by sending a high signal or high output from the microcontroller.
