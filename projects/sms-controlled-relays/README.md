## Summary

I have already written the complete description with links to schematic, board layout and c code here:


[http://ma-projects.blogspot.com/...](http://ma-projects.blogspot.com/2011/01/project-no-1-sms-controlled-relay.html)


If there are any questions or if the files can't be accessed just send me a mail and I'll send them to you.


i am planning to extend the program for this project to send sms's containing the positions of the relays or the temperature read from an analog sensor (schematic already contains a connector that would allow me to connect a temperature sensor) ... only problem is i have to do my final year project atm and don't get to do this one as well atm :P
