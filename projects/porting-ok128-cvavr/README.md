## Summary

This project is a small project. I am now living in Korea for my master degree. For experiment in our university, we bought AVR product atmega128 from [www.ohm.co.kr](http://www.ohm.co.kr) which type is OK128 v2.0. OK128 uses ATMEGA128 for the MCU.


Since the students are from mechanical engineering, I need an easier IDE, that's why I decided to port the code from WinAVR to CVAVR.


Several functions are hardware specific, It means that you need to check whether it fits your hardware requirement or not. We use the OK128 v2.0. I included the diagram of hardware in the zip file.
