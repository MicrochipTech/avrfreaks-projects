## Summary

Students in ECE 4760 at Cornell University were given the responsibility of choosing, designing and building a project using Atmel Mega32 microcontrollers. Over 30 projects this year include a trumpet MIDI contoller, a motorized guitar tuner, a eyeblink/head-motion computer controller, Biometric Authentication system, and a rocket inertial guidance system.

During the last 5 weeks of the semester in ECE 4760, Microcontroller Design, students have to combine sensors, actuators, microcontrollers, and mathematical techniques to build something.  

Some projects are infrastructure, such as a CANbus data acquisition system. Some are games, such as a 3D video maze. Many groups built some kind of robot or musical device. All projects show a great deal of originality and work. There are over 250 projects on the page.
