 * \brief  XMEGA Clock System driver header file.
 *
 *      This file contains the function prototypes and enumerator definitions
 *      for various configuration parameters for the XMEGA Clock System driver.
 *
 *      The driver is not intended for size and/or speed critical code, since
 *      most functions are just a few lines of code, and the function call
 *      overhead would decrease code performance. The driver is intended for
 *      rapid prototyping and documentation purposes for getting started with
 *      the XMEGA Clock System.
 *
 *      For size and/or speed critical code, it is recommended to copy the
 *      function contents directly into your application instead of making
 *      a function call.
 *
 * \par Application note:
 *      AVR1003: Using the XMEGA Clock System
 *
 * \par Documentation
 *      For comprehensive code documentation, supported compilers, compiler
 *      settings and supported devices see readme.html

 *
 *  \note Note that the oscillator cannot be used as a main system clock
 *        source without being enabled and stable first. Check the ready flag
 *        before using the clock. The function CLKSYS_IsReady( _oscSel )
 *        can be used to check this.
 *
 *  \param  _oscSel Bitmask of selected clock. Can be one of the following
 *                  OSC_RC2MEN_bm, OSC_RC32MEN_bm, OSC_RC32KEN_bm, OSC_XOSCEN_bm,
 *                  OSC_PLLEN_bm.
