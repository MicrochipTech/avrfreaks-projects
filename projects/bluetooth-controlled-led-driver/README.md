# Bluetooth Controlled Led Driver

## Summary

This project combines my basic Led Driver and the RS232 module to provide Bluetooth control of the Led Driver.


I have found it invaluable for debugging live code, because the bluetooth connection can feed back values from the controller as it is running.


The complete project is at [http://www.forward.com.au/Blueto...](http://www.forward.com.au/BluetoothLedDriver/BluetoothControlledLedDriver.html)


The first part is the RS232 module, second part covers  

 i) Converting the ThreeLevelLedDriver to an interrupt driven program  

 ii) Adding the RS232 module to the Led Driver program  

 iii) Controlling the Led from your computer  

 iv) Adding the Bluetooth connection  

 v) Extensions to the project


Detailed instructions for getting the bluetooth connection up and running are included. PC's with and without bluetooth are covered.
