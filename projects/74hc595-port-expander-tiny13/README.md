## Summary

This small project allows you to animate 8 LEDs attached to a Tiny13 via a 74HC595.


This project demonstrates how to use C on the Tiny13 to control 8 LEDs. It would not be hard to increase the number of output pins controlled by adding further 74HC595s.


I used AVRstudio with avr-gcc & Winavr to create the code for the Tiny13. With optimisation my code uses 404 bytes of flash and 24 bytes of eeprom.


This provides 16 "frames" of animation for the 8 LEDS.
