# 8-chan R/C Servo with FPGA

## Summary

In this project I have created an 8-channel R/C servo controller using ATmega16 & a Spartan XCS05 FPGA from Xilinx. AVRILOS is responsible for configuring the FPGA and then controlling the registers for driving up to 8 R/C servos. Also ATMega PWM drives directly two motors. The relevant article can be found here: [http://www.codeproject.com/KB/sy...](http://www.codeproject.com/KB/system/Avrilos03b.aspx) , along with a video demonstrating the project.
