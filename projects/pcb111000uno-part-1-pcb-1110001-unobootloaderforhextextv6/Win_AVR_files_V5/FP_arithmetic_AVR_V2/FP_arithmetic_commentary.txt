Commentary for the FP_arithmetic project
*****************************************************************

1. A simple project based on procedures found on the internet to do some basic arithmetic using the WinAVR maths library and send the results to a PC.

2. The makefile is edited so the "PRINTF_LIB_FLOAT" and "SCANF_LIB_FLOAT" are both selected.

3. There is an #include <math.h> statement at the start of the main FP_arithmetic.c file.

4. The user defines 3 files, one to which the c function putchar writes a character, one from which the function getchar will acquire a character and one from which the funcion scanf will acquire a floating point number.

5. The user defines subroutines uart_putchar(), uart_getchar() and uart_getDouble() each of which requires a pointer to the appropriate file.

6. The main routine uses the c-library functions putchar, getchar and scanf which call the user defined functions.

7. Results and text are printed using the prinf function in which text is defined between quotation marks and a format is required for the numbers.

8. The procedure does seem to work.  The best thing seems to be to just use it and leave the details to the compiler!

9. The project builds a very basic calculator that computes sine, cosine and log values and their reverse values and also does simple arithmetic.

10. At first glance the maths library looks pretty impressive in terms of its power, precision and low memory requirement.  How do they do it?!  

11. This project has been included as a means to testing a new bootloader for the UNO.  The bootloader copies this file and the FP_arithmetic.hex file to the UNO flash.

12. The first time that the program runs this file is printed line by line on the screen.  The user types X to exit the commentary after which the program runs normally.
