## Summary

This is the hardware and source code for an Atmel ATmega8 / MX-614 based UI only TNC. The intent was to provide inexpensive basic TNC functionality for APRS related packet activities. The design can operate as a standalone tracker, connected to a PC, or with other hardware that needs access to the APRS network, but does not have the resources to directly handle ax25 data (wx stations). It's seemed like overkill to use an expensive name brand TNC for the minimal ax25 implementation necessary for APRS.
