## Summary

First off I want to specify that this is not specific to WinAVR, but that was the closest menu selection. The target compiler is avr-gcc 4.3 and up, with avr-libc.


This is a C90  'work alike' with lots of 'extras', like sunrise and sunset functions.


It is designed as a 'supplement' to avr-libc, and installs itself into the tool chain, therefore requiring no explicit linker commands.


The attached zip contains source, manual, and a Makefile for command line installation.  

Type "make help" to get started.


PM me with any questions, tips or suggestions.
