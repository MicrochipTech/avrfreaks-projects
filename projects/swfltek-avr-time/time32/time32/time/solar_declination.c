    Were it not for the eccentricity of Earths orbit, this would be a trivial function.

    We compute the Earths orbital position with respect to perihelion, from which we derive a
    'velocity correction factor'. We then compute the orbital angle with respect to the
    December solstice, as 'modulated' by that correction factor.

    Due to the accumulation of rounding errors, the computed December solstice of 2135 will lag
    the actual solstice by many hours. A fudge factor, 'LAG', distributes the error across
    the 136 year range of this library.
