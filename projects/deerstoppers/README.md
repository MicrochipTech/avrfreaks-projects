## Summary

Im just starting in on c++ and programming the atmel chip directly. I was always an arduino guy before. I am brand new at this but I built a program The grand purpose is to turn off our motion activated deer sprayers around the garden and then automatically reenable them later. For some reason I can't remember to plug them back in sometimes and we lose half the garden overnight. Primary goals of the program are 3 1. keep sprayer pin high unless told to do otherwise 2. There will be a flashing led to provide warning if armed and notice if disarmed 3. It should be able to be reset manually Secondary goals are 1. dictate the amount of time you want the sprayer pin to be disarmed 2. use the minimum amount of parts possible (1 transistor, 1 led, 1 ATtiny85, 1 pushbutton)
