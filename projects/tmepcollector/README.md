## Summary

This is an AVR based temperature sensor logger. It interfaces 3 sensors. They can be silicon type and/or PT100. It faces the outside world through a RS485 line. The line can be 1km long or so. The software at the host CPU samples the values, and stores it. The board contains eeproms to store acquired data locally, but it is for further implementations.
