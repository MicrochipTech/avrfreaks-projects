## Summary

The “Tesla coil” has been around since the late 1800’s, and has been the subject of thousands of student science projects and can be considered one of the standards for entrance into the world of high voltage systems for the electrical hobbyist. They’ve been built as small as a quarter, and taller than a house. In just the last few years, the focus for Tesla “coilers” has changed from the old standard spark-gap and mechanical rotary-gap driven coils to new solid-state designs that allow microprocessor control over spark frequencies and duty cycle. This project is an Atmel AtMega16 based controller that will drive a solid-state Tesla coil power supply at frequencies defined by the MIDI standard for digital musical devices. 


This project was originally conceived from a brain-storming session on an internet forum, and the first version was completed in April 2006 using a Motorola MC68HC11E2 as the main processor. Version 2 (this project) is a re-design using an Atmel Atmega16 as the main processor, and a few user interface enhancements such as a PC keyboard for input, and an Optrex 20x4 LCD display.


This project was entered into the Circuit Cellar AVR contest.
