## Summary

If you are a home brewer you know that temperature and timing come up a lot.


I built this thing to make my brewing a little easier. After doing all the work I decided to post it so that others might want to take a crack at building one. I don't know how much interest there is in this so I didn't put a lot of time into describing it. If I see that there is sufficient interest to expand the information I will do so.


I used the Atmel ATMega 32 microprocessor chip because I had one. It has far more memory than needed and I don't use any of the A/D capability. For temperature sensors I used the Maxim (Dallas) DS18B20 1-Wire Digital Thermometer.


It has 26 timers and four temperature sensors.


I'm haveing problems uploading files or a link.
