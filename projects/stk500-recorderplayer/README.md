# STK500 Recorder/Player

## Summary

A nice little program that uses the STK500 and the AT90S8515 to record switches and play them back on LEDS. Switches 0, 1, and 2 are the main buttons, play, record, and clear. The rest of the switches(7, 6, 5, 4, 3) are the buttons used for keys that can be recorded than played back on the LEDS. In later versions I will add support for a speaker which will play different noises corresponding with different switches.
