Thank you for downloading this project!

I'm a engineerstudent from Finland. Currently studying embedded systems in Seinäjoki University of applied sciences.

I made this project just for fun and for a pcb-design course exercise.

Hopefully you get some new ideas from this project. I tried searching around the Internet an couldn't find basic rpm-meter.
With this you can count allmost any kind of pulse and adjust the correction multipliear to correct level.

If you liked this, I would like to have some feedback.

Questions!
