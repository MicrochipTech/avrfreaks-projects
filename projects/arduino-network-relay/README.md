# Arduino network relay

## Summary

Control your electrical devices (ON/OFF) through your local network or internet.


The electronic circuit based on arduino platform (I used arduino nano), an ENC28J60 ethernet module and an AS2302 humidity / temperature sensor. Instead of ENC28J60 ethernet module can be used the W5100 ethernet module just by changing the UIPEthernet library with the arduino stock Ethernet library.


Moreover, the circuit has an isolated  feedback switch for getting response from your remote device.


 


The whole circuit is controlled via the android application I wrote and can be downloaded for free from Google play
