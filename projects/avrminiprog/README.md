## Summary

AVRminiProg is an integration of my previous-developed AVR programming tools: AVRminiISP, AVRminiJTAG and AVRminiDragon, which emulate official USB-interfaced programmers from Atmel. U can use AVRminiProg in the right same way U use Atmel programmers. Software supports Atmelâ€™s programmer will also support AVRminiProg, and official AVRStudio is recommended.
