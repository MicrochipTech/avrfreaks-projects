## Summary

Any embedded development kit has its rich and practical hardware resources, which could help users to master the applications of AVR microcontroller chips. 


Generally, buzzer, timer, Watchdog,TWI,LED,Keys,AD,LCD,SPI and etc.., all the applications about above hardware resources are needed for AVR microcontroller chips beginners and the secondary development technical personnals.


The ATmel ATmega16 chip is widly used in many applications, the EasyANR M16 development kit is one AVR board , which has all the hardware resources above on board. In addition,its main advantage is that the EasyAVR M16 board has on-board simulation function and programming function , so it is used normally without AVR emulator,simulator or programmer.This is convenient for learning and development, also it reduces the whole cost for users.


The EasyAVR M16 development board have USB data interface and serial data interface, this make choice for using. When using USB line to do the connecting between the PC and the kit, users need not to supply power for the board, USB line could transmit data, also has the power supply function;when using the serial port for data transmitting, then it need to be added power supply, its voltage range is from 7.5V to 9V, any is OK.


Furthermore, the EasyAVR M16 development kit also could be used as simulator, emulator or programmer for other boards, which have standard JTAG or ISP interface.It is could be ok for just occasionally used for this function,but if it is regular done such applications, it is not suitable, I am afraid other boards may be damaged. Because there is no protection circuit , it may appear the phenomenon  

that the circuit is not stable.Please make sure this note.
