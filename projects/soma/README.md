## Summary

As a senior design we're building a group of robots to demonstrate swarm theory by mapping out a building. My part of the project is to build an IR localization module. In order to gain the best accuracy I'm using 8 IR photodiodes, each amplified to three different levels. I'm currently working on a method for sampling and determining an amplitude for all of them fast enough to have useful data.
