## Summary

This board was designed by Paul Main for use in second year education at LaTrobe University Electronic Engineering in the Microcontrollers Course - ELE22MIC. It was also used at Melbourne University Physics 640251. 


There are bilby - protoboard adapters which allows easy prototyping.


Also a RS485 isolator board (for DMX lighting control) is available.


The Bilby's board Schematic is available at [http://www.sea.vg/mic/2007/Hardw...](http://www.sea.vg/mic/2007/Hardware/bilby57_sch.pdf)


AVR course notes in MS Powerpoint format are available from <http://www.sea.vg/mic/2007> for the electronics course.


A quick start guide for using AVRStudio with GNU C is available at

AVR Programmers I recommend are are AVRISP (serial) or AVRISPII (USB). However we can supply a VERY cheap adapter board serial-port programmer which is compatible with the program Ponyprog.
