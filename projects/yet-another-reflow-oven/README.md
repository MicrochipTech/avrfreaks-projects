## Summary

Yet another reflow oven. This one is powered by an ATmega168. The temperature is read by a K-type thermocouple through a MAX6675 TC IC. The power is controlled by a pair of opto-isolated triac power boards (upper and lower heater elements). System output is via a three digit 7-segment display and input is controlled from a rotary encoder with a push switch. Data logging is also possible via the RS232 output.
