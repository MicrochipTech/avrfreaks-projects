## Summary

Welcome to the wonderful world of Binary Time^TM. Your new Binary  

Clock ushers in a whole new way of looking at the passing hours and  

days and years of your life. Instead of an easily readable clock  

face that uses Roman numerals, the Binary Clock^TM uses a cryptic  

arrangement of LEDs. In contrast to the whacky display system, the  

clock is set with an intuitive and innovative ONE button interface!


Only you will actually know what time it is. Assuming you can  

remember the conversion factors. But you're a highly paid computer  

professional, so it should be /easy/, right?

This is a binary clock that I made using an AT90S2313, but I'm sure other parts would do as well. I built this as a Christmas present, consequently, the documentation has something of a tongue in cheek tone. However, it does explain the use of the clock adequately and someone else may appreciate my humour, so I'm letting it stand...


Includes documentation, code, schematic and photo of built project.
