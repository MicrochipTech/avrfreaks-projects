## Summary

The intersection is located on a plywood board on which is placed stickers with the motif of the intersection. Four lights contain three LEDs - red , yellow (which replaces orange ) and green. Outside plate is placed a box with the control unit . Traffic lights can be removed and the plates opodjit - are connected to the control unit 6-wire ribbon cable , which can be freely detach a traffic light . The control unit can be disconnected from the cable to the opening - the connectors inside. The control unit contains a simple stabilized power supply with reverse polarity protection , ATMEGA48 microprocessor , potentiometer and display. The control unit can be powered by any source of 7 -24V. In my case, I used the " cube " into a 230V socket . Consumption of traffic lights and a two-digit segment display I restrained so that I could follow ATMEGA48 microprocessor directly without additional components such as transistors .


When you turn on all the lights amber LED flashes several times ( in the Czech Republic , this means that traffic lights are out of order ), and then run into a regular cycle , which is regularly alternate the two directions perpendicular to one another . The duration of the green can be of 0.1 to 9.9 the seconds potentiometer. The set time is displayed on the built- segment display on the control unit.
