## Summary

Here is the cdelay.h I use for most of my projects.Â  It requires defining the symbol F\_CPU with the number of cpu cycles, but then you can do delays in ns, us, ms, or s.


It will always select the next higher delay.


The \_approx functions may add up to 5 more cycles of delay at the savings of flash.
