## Summary

Libavrutil is an opensource software library written in C targeting as many members of the AVR uC family as possible. It's written in the hope that it will aid cross-platform (in terms of different microcontrollers) development. Designed to be generic, simple (thus hopefully easy to use) and efficient, libavrutil offers functionality like the Arduino core libraries (and some extensions) do. Any contributions to the code are appreciated, either those which improve the quality, performance or unification of the code.
