## Summary

Hi friends,


here is a wirelessly controlled toy car,controlled with Sony TV's IR remote. The car contains a single small motor controlled with two channels of the ATmega8. 


Six buttons of the remote are used for starting motor, stopping motor, speed increase / decrease and direction reverse / forward.


The project contains complete hardware with software which includes code for PWM control and decoding the IR codes of the remote control using on-board IR receiver TSOP1738.


Thanks & Regards.
