## Summary

DS3234 TCXO Real-time clock library for CodeVision AVR. Works with SPI mode 3 like SD-cards. Ideal for data logger if all free IO's are almost depleted and SPI is already utilized, otherwise consider DS3231M I2C MEMS RTC. Compiled with CVAVR 3.05, but should work with earlier versions of the compiler.


Library contains almost all features of the chip, but not square wave output. If you find bugs or make Improvements to the library, please let me know.
