It is critical that the fuses are set properly on the ATTINY24A.  The CKDIV8 fuse must be unchecked.  If you notice that the LED's are blinking terrible slow it is likely you forget to uncheck this fuse.  Clearing this fuse takes the uC from 1 MHz to 8 MHz.  You can optionally set BODLEVEL for brownout detection as well.  I've tested my PCB at brown-out detection at 4.3V and it seems to work just fine.

This results in these fuse byte values:  Extended=0xff, High=0xDC, Low=0xE2
