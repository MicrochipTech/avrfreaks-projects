# Card Swipe - Voting System

## Summary

I intend to use LED's as a source and photo transistor as a receiver. I have to integrate the circuit with 8951 atmel microcontroller. so when a card is swiped in between a sender and a receiver then it must detect it and produce a signal to microcontroller. later on i will display the count digitally on PC using serial interfacing with micro controller. I am a newbie to this hardware stuff and have no experience.
