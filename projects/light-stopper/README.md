## Summary

This is a pretty simple but fun game that uses the STK500 and the AT90S8515. The object of the game is to press the switch where the LED that is on is at. The LED that is on will travel back and forth on all of the eight LEDs. If you are succesfull you move onto a next level where the speed of the traveling LED is increased a little. If you miss then you start over. The level you are on is displayed in binary on the LEDs before the level begins. There is about 51 levels, but at 25 it gets pretty tough. It doesn't use timers but rather a delay function, in a later version I will replace the delay functions with a timer.
