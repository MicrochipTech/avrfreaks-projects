# Multiple DS18[B]20 on LCD

## Summary

This project support many sensors on the same wire using the ROM search method.  

Also the sensors are powered with parasite power, so only two wire needed to all sensors together.  

I have it tested with 7 sensors on a 20m cable.  

The temperature of DS1820 is displayed in steps of 0.5°C and DS18B20 in steps of 0.1°C.  

With a single key you can step trough all sensors, which are connected.  

On other connected 1-wire devices or I-buttons only the unique address was displayed.


I will add a more verbose description soon.
