## Summary

During the development of the [Xprotolab](http://www.gabotronics.com/development-boards/xmega-xprotolab.htm), I needed to test the I2C protocol sniffer. I thought that one cool way to do it was using a Wii Nunchuk, I would use one Xprotolab as the controller (running a simple program to read the data), and another Xprotolab to sniff the protocol.


The zip file contains the nunchuk driver, and a TWI driver (a modified version from the ATMEL TWI app note).
