For the file 'ExpressPCB.zip':

These are schematic and board layouts for the software produced 
by the guys at http://ExpressPCB.com

Note that I have not ordered any PCBs from version 2 and so it
may not be correct! I suggest you trace it out for yourself
before buying any PCBs! Just make sure I didn't mess up (I've
traced it through a few times myself!)

ti keyboard rev 2.pcb is the PCB layout file
PS2Keyboard rev 2.sch is the schematic

This layout has room for a connector for the PS/2 port, two
power connectors (to permit pass-through TI-99 power), two
keyboard connectors (to permit connecting the original
keyboard at the same time, though I'm not sure whether that
will actually work!), and has pads to connect wires for the
Alt+F9 through Alt+F12 output functionality.

If you do order a set of boards, let me know, I might buy one
off you so I can test the layout. ;)
