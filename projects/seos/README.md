## Summary

SEOS is a small and simple embedded RTOS. It is loosely based on the ADEOS operating system described in "Programming Embedded Systems in C and C++" by Michael Barr. It runs on the Atmel AVR ATmega processors. The main features of SEOS are a priority based cooperative multitasking scheduler, critical sections, serial port communications, and timer management. However, what's probably the best thing about SEOS is that it is very simple and easy to understand and provides a good starting point for more advanced applications.


SEOS was developed using WinAVR on the STK500 development board.
