# AD22103 LED thermometer

## Summary

Another thermometer. This one uses the T0-92 Analog Devices AD22103 linear temperture sensor. A Tiny26 (can be changed to any AVR with ADC) reads the voltage, converts it to a two-digit display of Fahrenheit degrees, and displays it on two 7-segment LEDs. To save power, the display is switched off for three seconds and displays the two numbers for one second. Accurate (I believe) to one degree F over the range of +16 to +110.  

 Complete documented source code in AVR assembler. A schematic file in GIF format. Feedback and suggestions welcome, especially if any defect in the determination of accuracy is detected.


Thank you.
