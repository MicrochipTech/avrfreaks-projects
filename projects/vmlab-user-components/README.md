## Summary

I have written several open source VMLAB components that others may find useful. They are available at: <http://sites.google.com/site/thvortex/vmlab>


The components I currently have available are:
* AVR Studio Stimulus/Logger - Stimulus and Logging components that use the same format as the AVR Studio simulator for data files.
* Verilog VCD Logger - Logging component that creates Verilog Value Change Dump format files.
* WAV Analog Stimulus/Logger - Analog stimulus and logging components that use WAV audio files.
* Break On Edge - Breakpoints the simulation on every rising edge of a signal.
* Digital Signal Delay - Digital buffer with user configurable propagation delays for rising and falling edges.
* COM Port Exchanger - Allows communication between VMLAB and a physical serial COM port.
* LED 7-Segment Display - A GUI component implementing a 7-segment display with decimal point.
