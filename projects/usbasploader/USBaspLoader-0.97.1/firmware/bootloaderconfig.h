/*
General Description:
This file (together with some settings in Makefile) configures the boot loader
according to the hardware.

This file contains (besides the hardware configuration normally found in
usbconfig.h) two functions or macros: bootLoaderInit() and
bootLoaderCondition(). Whether you implement them as macros or as static
inline functions is up to you, decide based on code size and convenience.

bootLoaderInit() is called as one of the first actions after reset. It should
be a minimum initialization of the hardware so that the boot loader condition
can be read. This will usually consist of activating a pull-up resistor for an
external jumper which selects boot loader mode.

bootLoaderCondition() is called immediately after initialization and in each
main loop iteration. If it returns TRUE, the boot loader will be active. If it
returns FALSE, the boot loader jumps to address 0 (the loaded application)
immediately.

For compatibility with Thomas Fischl's avrusbboot, we also support the macro
names BOOTLOADER_INIT and BOOTLOADER_CONDITION for this functionality. If
these macros are defined, the boot loader usees them.

 * the BOD voltage and if the watchdog is enabled by fuses.
 * 
 * The magic will be: 0xf??????? in binary 0b1111ZZZZ YYYYYYYY WXXXVUUU TTSSSRRR
 * 
 * --> where the 4 bit of Z correspond to the middle of the 3 byte AVR signature:

 * If your clockspeed is different from the presented 8, this coding scheme is

 * 	4.5V (ususally 5V)	 <-->	   V == 0
 * 	3.3V			 <-->	   V == 1

 * If your PORT is different from the presented 8:
 * This coding scheme is more an example. UUU=0b000 really means, the first GPIO port
 * on the specified MCU. (0b001 is the second, 0b010 the third...)
 * Normally there aren't more then 8 GPIO ports on an AVR - so this coding works.
 * If there are more then 8, only the first 8 ports can be encoded and otherwise
 * this coding scheme is not applicable for you - please ask for a personal magic in this case.
 * 
 * 
 * --> where the 2 bit of T define the external interrupt used for USBD
 * 	INT0			 <-->	  TT == 0b00
 * 	INT1			 <-->	  TT == 0b01
 * 	INT2			 <-->	  TT == 0b10
 * 	INT3			 <-->	  TT == 0b11
 * If you use a different interrupt, this coding scheme is not applicable
 * for you - please ask for a personal magic in this case.
 * 
 * 
 * --> where the 3 bit of S define the PIN (on the previous encoded port) for USB+
 *     (basically the value of USB_CFG_DPLUS_BIT)
 * 	0			 <-->	 SSS == 0b000
 * 	1			 <-->	 SSS == 0b001
 * 		...
 * 	7			 <-->	 SSS == 0b111
 * 
 * 
 * --> where the 3 bit of R define the PIN (on the previous encoded port) for USB-
 *     (basically the value of USB_CFG_DMINUS_BIT)
 * 	0			 <-->	 RRR == 0b000
 * 	1			 <-->	 RRR == 0b001
 * 		...
 * 	7			 <-->	 RRR == 0b111
 * 
 * 
 * WARNING:
 * 	Please note, that this 0xf------- magic does not include
 * 	any information about the bootloader condition pin (and port)!
 * 	This magic just ensures basic protection against different
 * 	layouts. (Which only covers essential data)
 * 
 * 	?Maybe as a heuristic?: 
 * 	The bootloader condition pin should be the same port as USB,
 * 	at the pin before USB_CFG_DMINUS_BIT.
 * 
 * 	If you want to be very safe, request your own magic...
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Examples (USB pinning are defaults from this file):
