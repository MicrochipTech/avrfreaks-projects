## Summary

Developed completely in C++ (apart from C and ASM system calls), the CCCC framework (pronounced quad-c) will handle tasks, events, and resources. Using a simple, flexible communication protocol, resources can be provided and shared between devices efficiently. Utilizing object-oriented programming, a huge amount of effort can be abstracted away from the developer, who only need worry about creating the resource, event, and task objects and configuring the environment. CCCC is, for all intensive purposes, an operating system for micro-controllers which is completely event-driven, requiring no task switching, scheduling or prioritizing. Interrupts are handled cleanly, requiring no 'volatile' variables. Great effort will be made to make the system incredibly easy to use, yet flexible and as light on its feet as possible. Still, the full system will likely only be available for controllers with over 16kB of non-volatile memory. Smaller, customizable compatible systems will be available for smaller controllers. To begin with, target development platforms will be the Mega328-P and XMega. Additional controllers will be ported to latter, including PIC, ARM, and Parallax controllers. Anyone who wants to contribute to the project can request the current source by contacting me. I release this code into public domain. I have not abandoned this project. I've simply put it on a back burner for now.
