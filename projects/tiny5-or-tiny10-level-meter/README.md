# Tiny5 or Tiny10 as a level meter

Uploaded by bhammill on 2010-11-17 14:40:00 (rating 0 out of 5)

## Summary

Simple A/D converter example using CodeVisionAVR. Useful as a "high/medium/low" level indicator. Useful as an on-card voltage monitor for diagnostics, battery level meter, etc.


I'm releasing this project because I notice that there is a shortage of good Tiny5 / Tiny10 examples.


I'll port the code to IAR EWAVR when I get a chance but it should be pretty simple.
