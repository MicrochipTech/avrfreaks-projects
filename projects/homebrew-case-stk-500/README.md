## Summary

By itself the STK-500 is a pain to store, and to use on anything other than a clear bench top. I've made a nice case for my STK-500 out of a vinyl covered game case. It's much nicer than the makeshift case I made for my old STK-500 out of a cardboard box. The site includes pictures and a description of how I made the case.
