# HCMS-29xx LED matrix display

## Summary

The HCMS-29xx display is a neat LED dot matrix LED display for 4, 8, or 16 characters. 5 different LED colour versions exist. Each character is made up of 5*7 pixels that must be controlled individually.


The small format makes this display a good choice where space is more important than power consumption.


This library is to a very large extent based on the same code as the Nokia 3310 display project. The character set is identical.


Included in this .zip file are:  

2 Library files for the BASCOM-AVR compiler  

1 Example main program file  

1 MS Excel document with a simple character generator  

3 Data sheets covering the display series  

1 Photo of the HCMS-2961 in a breadbord demo


The BASCOM-AVR basic compiler is available for download at [www.mcselec.com](http://www.mcselec.com). This library was created using the free demo version limited to 4 kB program code. (I am not affiliated with this company.)


The file HCMSinit.bas is thoroughly commented and includes detailed instructions. It is my hope that they will answer all your questions. For more information you could also consult the BASCOM-AVR help menu.
