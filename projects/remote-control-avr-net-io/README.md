## Summary

This windows mobile app for the HTC HD2 can be used as remote control for the AVR NET-IO Board from Pollin. It is possible, to control the AVR microcontroller via the internet.


The mobile app can be freely used for personal purposes. Commercial usage would require my explicit agreement.
