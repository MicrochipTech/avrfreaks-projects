DESCRIPTION:
UDP2EMAIL is a Microsoft Visual Basic program that demonstrates
how to send an e-mail from a SitePlayer UDP packet. It binds to
the PC's IP and Port address via the Winsock UDP protocol. When
a packet is received, it sends out an e-mail using the VB MAPI 
controls. This example simply time stamps and e-mails the packet
it receives by using the FormatEmail function which is located
in the UDP2EMAIL.BAS file. You should modify this function to 
meet your own needs.

PROGRAM USAGE:
Run UDP2EMAIL.EXE. Enter the IP address of the computer network
card you will use. Enter the Port that it will listen on. Enter
the profile name of the e-mail account that you will send from.
Enter the recipient's e-mail addresses separated by a ";"
semicolon. Enter the e-mail subject line. Press the Bind Port
button to begin listening for UDP packets. If the AutoSend box
is checked, UDP2EMAIL will send e-mail whenever a UDP packet is
received.

SITEPLAYER PREPARATION:
You must use SitePlayer firmware v1.5 or later in order to send
UDP packets. You should also download the software setup dated
07.03.01 or later which includes the Factory demo w/UDP
features, the UDPsend_def.inc file, and the updated
documentation. Ensure that the SitePlayer UDP settings in the
UDPsend_def.inc are compatible with those specified in the
UDP2EMAIL PC IP and PC Port fields. The defaults should work
without editing. Then, instruct SitePlayer to send a UDP message
out by using either the Factory demo page or the serial
commands. See the SitePlayer Software Manual for more
information concerning UDP packets.
