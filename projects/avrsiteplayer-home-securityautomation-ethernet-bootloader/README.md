## Summary

Not the best documented project out there I'm sure. But I wanted to give back what I could to the community. This project interfaces an ATmega32 and Siteplayer websever to control some home security features as well as some home automation. Probably the most unique feature is the custom bootloader which allows the use of the provided VB program to re-flash the AVR over the web.
