## Summary

I interfaced the DELTA SIGMA A/D converter ADS1210P (BURR BROWN) with the computer through an ATmega8535. Via PC I can measure the voltage applied to the Converter inputs (the voltage measured appears on the PC screen in Volts) and I can send commands to the Converter through PC (Self Calibration,Sleep,increase data-output frequency,etc.). If you are interested on it you can reply to me and I will send you more informations about it.
