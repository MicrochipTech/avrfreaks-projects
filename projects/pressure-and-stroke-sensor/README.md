# Pressure and stroke sensor

## Summary

Hallo everyone,


I am doing my first project with ATMega16 and as a compiler AVR Studio4. I have to control a pump using these 2 sensors. once when the max pressure is reached the pressure should stop working and second when the max stroke is reached the pump should also stop working. I should also see my actual pressure and stroke on my display. but i have the following problems:


1st i am not able to show the stroke as a number with comma values i am only getting as results 1 or 2 or 3 althow i am using float and i should get output values with commas!


Second i don't know how to use 2 input pins for my sensors data and than read from each input a value and show it on my display. can someone here also help me. as i said it's my new project and i am new here.  

the code i have done untill now and that works very good with the stroke sensor the only problem is that i am not getting a comma value as i said


Thanks for everyone that will try to help me in advance
