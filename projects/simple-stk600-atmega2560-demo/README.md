## Summary

There didn't seem to be much code out there for the STK600, and I thought I would post a getting started project. It uses a non-linear algorithm for LED brightness so it looks linear to the human eye. It uses timer0 for PWM and pulses the LEDs back and forth like Cylons or Night Rider, and the push-button switches control the speed.
