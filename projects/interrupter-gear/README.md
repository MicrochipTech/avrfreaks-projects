## Summary

During World War I and slightly before World War II, military fighter aircraft had machine guns mounted to fuselage of the plane. These machine guns were mounted right behind the propeller. The first question that comes to mind is how can the gun fire and not hit the propeller blades as they are spinning? This project uses an airsoft gun to shoot through a model airplane propeller.
