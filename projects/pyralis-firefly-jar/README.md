## Summary

This project is based on the hardware from the [Jar of Fireflies Instructable](http://www.instructables.com/id/Jar-of-Fireflies). My firmware should run on hardware already built for that project.


I wanted to go a step farther when I built the firefly jar as a Christmas present. My goal was to have multiple fireflies interacting, including males that sometimes synchronize with each other, and females that respond to the flashes of males. I also wanted to base it on the behavior of our backyard firefly, *Photinus pyralis*, the common Eastern firefly, which is also one of the best studied. I wrote my own software for the microcontroller to simulate this behavior.


Pictures and full documentation for this project is available [here](http://kjordahl.net/firefly.html). Firmware was tested on ATtiny85, but should also work on ATtiny45. Latest firmware is on [Github](http://github.com/kjordahl/Pyralis).
