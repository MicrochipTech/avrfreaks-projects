## Summary

Simple signal generator, using one wire on a tiny anything, with pwm, and a low pass filter.


I needed several digits of precision, at relatively low speed signals, 12.98Hz and 13Hz is the difference, between getting kicked or not.


Could also be easily adapted for a low speed generator for any other projects. It runs up to 400Hz without any modification, with several digits of precision.

I'm using a 560ohm resistor and 10uf cap as a low-pass filter, since the on board adc is a bit more complicated than I'm going to trace, It's estimated at a 2kohm load.
