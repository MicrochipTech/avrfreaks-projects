# Simple PID regulator

## Summary

Simple implementation of PID controller,  

written in pure C (platform independent).


I've tried to make it similar to C++ class  

(struct-object and methods) for simplicity  

and fixed point int (last 4 bits interpreted as  

fractional value) for better performance.
