## Summary

The BL4 light beacon is the heart of an art project to challenge people who are observant, curious and at least a bit clever. The beacons consists of only a battery, an LED and an AVR microcontroller, preferably the cheapest ATtinyÂ´s. The provided C-code is a first functioning crude version with some degrees of power saving by using idle sleepmode and light measurement (by reverse-biasing the LED) to shut down the transmission during daylight. 


More skilled programmers are encouraged to help improving the software and port it to other families of realy cheap microcontrollers. All fans of the project are also encouraged to help spreading the project all over the world! 


The purpose of the beacons is to point out a webpage with a short URL. A personal subfolder can also be pointed out, but that will offcourse make the transmitted message longer. I see this project as a possible alternative to the now very popular "square barcodes" seen everywhere in ads. 


HereÂ´s an early (and slightly "buggy") version of the beacon at Youtube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guAqUHFzdBw)


And a more recent video of the improved V1.3:

I continously fail to upload any files to AVRfreaks but hereÂ´s  

a folder at the project homepage containing all files:
