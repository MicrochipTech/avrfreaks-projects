## Summary

Dot Matrix Display used in this project is a 7 Rows by 5 Column single color LED Matrix Display. LEDs in the Module is arranged in the way that the Row Lines are connected to the Cathodes of the LEDs and the Column Lines are connected to the Anodes. In order to display any character on the display specific pattern is required to be updated on Row lines while the column lines are to be scanned in a timely manner so that the scanning is not visible to the viewer. A timer is usually used to do it (Timer 0 is used in this example) to maintain the strict timing requirements.


The Flexibility of having a vero-board included in the AVR Project Board make it ideal for developing code library for the basic building block of a big application. 5 x 7 Dot-matrix LED Display is one of the example.


In this example the Column Lines are connected to PORTB and Row Lines are connected to the PORTD.


Schematic and wiring to the Project Board are depicted in the pictures.
