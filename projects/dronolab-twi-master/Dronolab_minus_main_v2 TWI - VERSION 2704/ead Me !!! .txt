Dronolab UC3C TWIM driver 

This driver uses Dronolab Singleton::get()->

which returns a pointer to an object containing all UC3C driver handler object such as uart,spi,twi,pwm,adc,flash.
This object is use in twi interrupt handlers since those are not member of the class Twi
To use this code properly, replace "Singleton::get()->" by your own Twi object.

Here an exemple:


uint16_t* pdata;
uint16_t  data;

Twi twi(&AVR32_TWIM0);

pdata = &data;

//This part of code read a 2bytes data from a sonar (Write : 0xE0 , Read : 0xE1)

//Sending register to be read (register 0x02)
TwiMsg * msg = twi.build_new_message(TwiMsg::WRITE);
msg->address(0xE0);
msg->data_to_send(0x02);
s.twi.message_builded(); //Msg is added to twi queue

//Reception of data
msg = s.twi.build_new_message(TwiMsg::READ);
msg->address(0xE1);
msg->data_to_recv(((uint8_t *) data) + 1);
msg->data_to_recv(((uint8_t *) data) + 0);
s.twi.message_builded(); //Msg is added to twi queue
