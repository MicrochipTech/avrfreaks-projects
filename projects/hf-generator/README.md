## Summary

Online translation (sorry for poor English):


Generator HF  

40-90 MHz left sine (90-160 MHz)  

synthesized by PLL, not of 10kHz (25-100kHz)  

controlled by ATmega8


The goal of this study is not to produce a radio transmitter but a generator of laboratory of very low power, making it possible to try out circuits VHF like filters for example, in order to confront the theory with the experiment, without radiating. The apparatus must be locked up in a metal case connected to the mass. The exit of the signal will be done on a catch BNC. A filter VHF will be inserted on the food. See the bonds at the foot of the page concerning the attribution of the radio frequencies.


Rather than to deliver to you in block the final diagram together with some approximate explanations, I prefer for this realization to describe you step by step the stages (and adventuresâ€¦) of its design.
