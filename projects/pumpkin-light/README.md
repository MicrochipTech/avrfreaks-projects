# Pumpkin Light

## Summary

Pumpkin Light uses two high-output 5mm white LEDs, a nine volt battery, a ATtiny13v and a handful of parts to create a flasher that you can put inside a pumpkin or other light-up decoration.


Included in the archive is the asm source which implements three distinct flashing patterns. The ATtiny13v's internal timer is used to interrupt each pattern and advance to the next. The patterns are Shimmer, Strobe and Alternate. Additional flashing patterns can be added simply. Very little of the ATtiny13v's program space is used up by this program.


This is written in AVR Studio 4 assembly.
