## Summary

I need to make a program for Atmega 16 which counts pulses on the external port B pin 0 (T0),  

triggering pulses to the front edge (solve inside the program).These pulses for example represent pulses with turbine flow meters.  

Each pulse means that the tube passed through the 2 liter of water.This flow appear as a binary number on LEDs 0-3.  

When all the diodes are ON is necessary to reset the state variable "k" to zero and display on LEDs and all the way around.  

 In addition I need to display the elapsed time between two pulses per second as a binary number on the LEDs 4,5,6,7.  

 Using the RS232 serial communication.I need to display the number of burning LEDs (as a decimal number)  

using the Hyper Terminal program.
