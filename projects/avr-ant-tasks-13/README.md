## Summary

AVR Ant Tasks is a collection of task definitions for Ant, the Java based Apache build utility.  

AVR Ant Tasks enable Ant to drive the avr-gcc compiler and linker to compile, link and convert the resulting object code to the Intel-Hex format. Another task is used to drive the uisp utility, enabling Ant to upload the compiled code to the AVR controller.
