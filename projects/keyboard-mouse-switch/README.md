## Summary

A KVM-switch is a device for sharing one set of keyboard/monitor/mouse for several computers. KVM stands for Keyboard / Video / Mouse. This document is a detailed guide on how to build a KVM-switch without the video-switching and is for that reason called a KM-switch.  

This switch lets you connect a USB-mouse and a PS/2-keyboard to 3 computers.
