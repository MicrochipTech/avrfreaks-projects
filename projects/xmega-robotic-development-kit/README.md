## Summary

This Robot toy has been posted with schematics, source code and all development tools. It was designed from the basis of a ATMEL Zigbee development kit and comprises of a Robot unit, remote and IR- station. The robot and remote communicate via ATMELâ€™s Zigbee stack, so multiple units can share data.  

An RFID reader is build into the base of the robot to detect RFID-objects. This was originally used to play real-life multiplayer strategy games, but all information regarding it has now been posted.
