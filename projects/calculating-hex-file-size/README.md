## Summary

Hi,


I am using AVRSTUDIO-4 to compile the programs.And ATMega2313 MCU with 2KB flash memory.  

But when i compiled the program the size of the .HEX file is displayed as 6KB of size in the PC. Should i consider that size as final size (or) is there any other methods to calculate the exact size of the .HEX file.


please let me know.
