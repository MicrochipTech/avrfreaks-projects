## Summary

For those that are addicted to railway models: these **stand-alone** pieces control the opening and closing of railway crossing gates with


* a servomotor, or
* a stepper motor.

Open and close positions can be configured by two trims, another trim regulates the speed of closing and opening. Gate status is displayed on a red/green LED that can be used as traffic light. Total costs are below $10 and small PCB layouts are provided. Software is in assembler and extensively commented.

All software can be downloaded from the project locations.
