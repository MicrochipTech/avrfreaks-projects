# Hot Wheels Radar Gun Hack

## Summary

This project describes the inner secrets of the Mattel Hot Wheels Radar Gun (about $20 to $30) and its ATmega88. It then describes how I made a few minor modifications to put in RS-232 communications.


A command processor (written in ICCavr C) is described and implemented which allows all the functions of the gun to be controlled via the serial interface.


This edited version of the original posting points out that a much easier way to modify the hardware would be to replace the original LCD with a HD44780 based 16x2 LCD module in 4 bit mode. This would preclude trace cutting and rerouting on the pcb. This version also includes minor bug fixes.
