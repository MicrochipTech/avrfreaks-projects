# Robot development kit - Robonii

Uploaded by admin on 2012-01-14 08:17:00 (rating 0 out of 5)

## Summary

The Robonii-robot toy was designed using At-Xmega chips and combines the following development kits: Zigbee, RFID, USB, IR, LCD and motor control.  

The toys was sold with a game writer. The company went bust and released some of the code and scematics making it a very nice development kit.


The units can be bought as toys from Amazon, and the scematics and startup code (programable via USB bootloader) available. Have a look at the Robonii face book profile for more detail.


Let me know if any one is interested.
