# POD devices - tutorial

Uploaded by drmpftemp on 2011-04-22 07:13:00 (rating 5 out of 5)

## Summary

It provides a complete solution for controlling arbitrary microcontroller devices from your mobile phone. The solution presented here consists of a Mobile Phone J2ME java application (jars provided), a protocol specification and a Led Driver (attiny84 asm provided) that implements the protocol.


Because the POD protocol is an operations discovery protocol, the same PODapp can be used to control any PODdevice. The PODdevice tells the PODapp what navigation and menus to present to the user and what commands the user can send to the PODdevice.


The POD protocol is very simple with minimal message structures and is readily implemented by small micro-processors such as the Atmel ATTINY series.


This tutorial extends the Bluetooth Controlled Led Driver.  

The zip file contains a complete set of pdf, jars and asm code (as at 22nd April 2011)
