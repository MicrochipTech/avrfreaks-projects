## Summary

A simple project to show how to setup the Salvo RTOS to do simple multitasking using the freeware Salvo Tiny library with ICCAVR v8 C compiler. Salvo tiny has unlimited tasks and events, but does not have priorities or timeout support.  

The freeware Lite library is full function but is limited to 3 tasks. This project will blink 8 LEDs using the eBox hardware sold by ImageCraft, the eBox has a Mega16 and includes a 7 segment display used in this demo. This project is intended to show basic rtos setup and use. Use as a starter for your projects. Flash size is only 1700 bytes, so lots of room for expansion.
