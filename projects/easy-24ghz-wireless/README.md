## Summary

Transmit wirelessly between two devices @2.4GHZ using an RF24G module and an atmega8515L. Any module equipped with the Nordic nRF2401A should work.


You can buy these modules here:

Included is source code, schematic, parts list and data sheet for the module. I also included a programmer cable schematic and software to program the avr. This should help someone starting out who wants to learn a bit about wireless.


Good Luck
