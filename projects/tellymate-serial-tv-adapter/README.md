*Reprogrammable Fonts increase it's flexibility*


Serial processing is interleaved within the video signal generation meaning the video signal is not interrupted.


It's ideal as a debugging or output interface to AVR projects. Its autobauding option means it can be used with internally clocked AVRs (It's amazing what a lowly Tiny13 can produce - see the Brownian Motion and Skiing game examples).


The standard font (Code Page 437) has graphics characters to allow lines, boxes, double-lined boxes etc.


Most TellyMates have one fontbank available, but up to 11 are available in a Mega328p.  

Each row of the display can use a different fontbank (where available).  

The fontbank(s) can be reprogrammed via control sequences. This allows you to define your own characters or graphics.
