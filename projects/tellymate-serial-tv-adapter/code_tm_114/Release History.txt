TellyMate Release History
=========================

1.0.14	(19th August 2009)
Fontbanks can now be reprogrammed.
Each fontbank is programmed in 6 separate chunks by calling the new 'Program Fontbank' control sequence.
The data to program into the fontbank is supplied by filling the screen with hex data prior to the 'Program Fontbank' call.
Note that after each call to 'Program Fontbank', the TellyMate is automatically reset.

For further details, see the UserGuide or the example Arduino Sketch 'Program Font'.

1.0.13	(21st July 2009) (not publically released)
Alternative Cursor Advance option added, (<ESC>x<) and (<ESC>y<). This moves the cursor down, rather than right after a character.
No scrolling is triggered. The 'alternative cursor advance' overrides any other automatic newline behaviour.

1.0.12	(6th July 2009) (not a publically released)
Fontbank support added (for devices with > 8kb flash).
Each Row can determine which font of 256 characters should be used.
	<ESC>_6 sets fontbank 0 (the default, code-page 437)
	<ESC>_7 sets fontbank 1
	<ESC>_8 sets fontbank 2
	<ESC>_9 sets fontbank 3
	...
	<ESC>_A sets fontbank 11
Mega8/88 based TellyMates (the norm.) only have fontbank 0.
Mega168 based TellyMates have fontbanks 0-3.
Mega328p based TellyMates have fontbanks 0-10.

The contents of the fontbanks are yet to be finalised.

This was an internal release to serve as a test-bed for font collections.

1.0.11	(25th June 2009)
Suppress Output option added
	<ESC>x; Enabled 'Suppress Output' (stops all sync/signal output)
	<ESC>y; Disable 'Suppress Output' (restores generation of sync/signal output)

1.0.10  (20th June 2009)
Mega168 support added
Mega328p support added
Added the following transmit functionality (for suitably configured hardware)
	<ESC>^n  Send Data (where n is '0' to '6')
	<ESC>`rc Send character at r,c [without moving cursor]. It uses the same r,c encoding as <ESC>Yrc

1.0.9   (9th June 2009)
Fixed Bug in Diagnostic information
Added transmit functionaility (for suitably configured hardware) - <ESC>~~~~ for "transmit-enable" and <ESC>| for "send character"

1.0.8   (20th May 2009)
Added <ESC>x: and <ESC>y: to hide / unhide the whole display. Useful for 'flashing' the whole screen as an alert.

1.0.7	(23rd Mar 2009)
Changes to compile under WinAVR 20090316

1.0.6	(10th Mar 2009)
PAL/NTSC selection by jumper.
	WARNING:
	This version (and above) has changed the meaning of Jumper 6.
	In prior versions, J6 was "Automatic Carriage Return when a Line Feed is received"
	In this version onwards, J6 is "PAL" output.

	<ESC>x9 and <ESC>y9 can be used to control "Auto CR" instead.

	If you want NTSC output, leave J6 open.
	If you want PAL output, put a jumper on J6.

'Diagnostic Information' has been shortened.

1.0.5	(3rd Mar 2009) (not published)
Mega88 support added
Bugfix: Option jumpers (4,5 and 6) are now read correctly.
Bugfix: Jitter removal in sync_handler_display now makes more sense.

1.0.4	(25th Feb 2009)
NTSC enabled version.

1.0.3	(23rd Feb 2009) (not published)
Private release of first-cut NTSC option (for testing)

1.0.2	(20th Feb 2009) (not published)
Bugfix: When "Line Overflow" was enabled, an overflow caused the next line to be cleared. The next line is no longer cleared.

1.0.1
Removed the debugging '<ESC>Q' stowaway that cleared the screen to Es and 0s.
Replaced with a more useful 'Diagnostic Information' <ESC>Q that shows the current state.

1.0.0
First published release.
