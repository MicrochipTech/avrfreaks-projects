Infrared Entry Alert Door Chime
Wednesday February 9, 2011.

Install the Receiver at one end and Transmitter at other end of doorway. Transmitter transmits 0x55 repeatedly every 100mS. If the beam is broken, receiver circuit rings a buzzer or turns on a relay, Then waits for 5 seconds before re-arming itself.

Be sure to line up the Infrared emitter (transmitter) with the infrared receiver perfectly for best results.

I did this because my kids play hockey in the basement (right next to my workshop). They know enough to close the door so I don't get a HOCKEY PUCK shot at my 19" monitor. Trouble is, they always forget to leave the door open when they are done playing. This is bad for air circulation, humidity, etc, etc, etc....

Sick and tired of telling them to leave the door open, even posted a big sign at the bottom of the stairs (leave door open!) they don't see it after a few times up & down (they are kids), so I decide to make a "Reminder" device.

When anyone passes the infrared beam, it triggers an MP3 player hooked to a small amplified PC speaker that plays a warning "Did you leave the F&@#!N door open?" (but in a nice way)

The problem has been solved. Door is now always open when they are not drilling the puck at the wall!

Code works with an AT90S2313 or an ATTINY2313 with external 4MHz crystal. If using an attiny2313, be sure to program the fuses as follows:

fuse low  = 0xFD
fuse high = 0xDF
fuse ext  = 0xFF

If you make changes to the code, just double click assemble.bat. To program with avrdude, just double click program.bat. (edit the program.bat file to specify the port used and the programmer being used)

If you know a better or more efficient way to do this with an avr, please message me on avrfreaks,
