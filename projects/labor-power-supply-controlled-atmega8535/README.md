## Summary

For a long while I had the idea in mind to construct a power supply for my labor with the possibility to try a servo motor or a sensor without the need of an auxiliary circuit.


This year I finally decided that an AVR controller in combination with a standard PC power supply would be the best to meet the conditions. 


Although I didn't yet realize all functions my power supply is already working since a while and I'm happy with it. So I can recommend :-) this kind of power supply manly for the use in modeling and robotics...


The report is in French, but you never know, may be I will find the time some day to translate it...
