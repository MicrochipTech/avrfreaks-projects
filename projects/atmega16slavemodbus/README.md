# ATMega16_SlaveModbus

## Summary

This code was created by several authors, whose libraries have been found by me a little browsing on the internet and making some changes to adattrle to my hardware.  

I used a ATMEGA16 with 16MHz quartz, a SN75176 chip and nothing else.  

For the test I used a converter Sollae communication (Ethernet-RS232, 485.422) and the program MBus Poll version 3.6.  

I'm experiencing a problem with the multiple write Holding Register (CODE 10H), but otherwise seems to work.
