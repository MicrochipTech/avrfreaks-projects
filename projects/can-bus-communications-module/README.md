## Summary

The canbus communications module is called NE-CM320, it is used to help users to do the instrumentsâ€™ design, which has CAN-bus communication interface. This module incorporates many things on it, for example, 8 bit microcontroller, CAN controller, the can transceiver, power supply circuit, isolation circuit, bus protection and etc.. All components are arranged in a miniature package module.


The embedded CAN module can be installed to the deviceâ€™s circuit board, it could be connected with the external control signal through the I / O or serial port. In many applications, the user only need to transmit the field I / O or UART data to the CAN-bus network, the canbus communications module is a reliable, rapid and convenient choice. 


The NE-CM320 communications module has the characteristics as modular design, the compact size, a small quantity of interface pins and etc..The NE-CM320 module can make the device get CAN-bus communicate interface on the base of not changing the original hardware structure. It makes easy to use the NE-CM320 module in the device, which has UART interface.Its main function as this, realize the communication between the CAN-bus network and the devices, which have UART interface.


The embedded CAN module could achieve the setting of serial communication rate and CANâ€™s parameters. Thanks to the CAN-bus advantages as below: development and maintenance of low cost, higher bus utilization, long distance transmission, high speed transmission rate, reliable error detection and handling mechanism and ect.., all those advantages above making up for the deficiency of the traditional RS485 network. The CANbus communications module helps user building the stable and efficient field bus control system. The CAN module could be widely used on instrumentation, instrumentation, petrochemical, power monitoring, engineering machinery, automotive electronics and etc.. 


The CANbus communications module includes an high performance microcontroller, the chips of Flash,RAM,EEROM and watchdog,bus driver. All these components are integrated in a 6.5 square centimeters module.


Users could operate the CANbus communications module without knowing any CAN-bus relevant knowledge, the module helps realizing the data communications between UART equipment and CAN-bus network. In addition, UART output to TTL level, the user can according to need external RS232 or RS485 transceiver, construct RS232 or RS485 net.


The size of the embedded CM320 module is only 32 mm Ã— 20 mm x 9.5 mm, standard feet spacing 100 mil (2.54 mm), double row needles spacing 600 mil.The CANbus communications module could be used as a DIP-28 integrated circuit, its volume is small and function is all ready,the users do not need to connect any peripheral components. This module make the equipment connecting to CAN-bus network through the UART port.
