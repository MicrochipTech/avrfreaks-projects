## Summary

 This project has been around a few years and uses the attiny2313 or the obsolete at90s2313. Construction details are included. The original design used the PS/2 keyboard and mouse ports. It thus required a USB/PS/2 converter to work with modern computers. As of January 2008 there are now also hex, avr-gcc source and instructions to make a USB version using the at90usbkey demo board.
