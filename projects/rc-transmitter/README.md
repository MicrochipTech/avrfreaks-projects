# RC Transmitter

## Summary

If you want to build your own RC transmitter then using a commercial HF module such as the Graupner/JR Sender-HF-Modul Part Nr 4057 or the Graupner/JR PLL-SYNTHESIZER-Sender HF-Modul Part Nr 4059 is a good idea. Another alternative is a 2.4GHz module like the Jeti Duplex TU2 EX ([http://jetimodel.com/index.php?p...](http://jetimodel.com/index.php?page=product&id=197))


Using such a module you will not have to worry about a transmitter license nor will you have to worry about building the HF-portion of the transmitter. These modules take a Pulse Position Modulation signal as input.


This program reads steering sticks on the transmitter and generates the Pulse Position Modulation signal.


It is my intention to continue developing the program till it outperforms top commercial transmitters for my specific use (RC speedboat competition). The version planning is included in the documentation in the beginning of the program here posted.
