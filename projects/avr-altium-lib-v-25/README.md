## Summary

Hi  

This is a good Altium lib which has a lot of components  

like avr-8051-AT91SAM7X-connectors-lcds....  

I have just added some AVR32 parts!  

Now it has support for ATXMEGA A1 Devices.  

so if you like it and if you have other parts which you can upgrade my lib please  

send me a feed back.  

I want to make this lib the best for hobby electronics and microcontrollers.


Several updates included in version 2.5 (download from url).
