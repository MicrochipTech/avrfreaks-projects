## Summary

Hello,


I'd like to expose my new project named "OS48", a preemptive multitasking kernel. I created last year a similar project "OS47". This project is more mature and has been designed from scratch. It's an Arduino C++ lib.


I designed this kernel in order to execute different functions at the "same time". The kernel is especially designed to Arduino Uno,Mega and leonardo.


Some features:


- 5 scheduling algorithms (1 cooperative and 4 preemptives)


- stack overflow detection


- task management (suspend, abort, sleep, resume)


- semaphores, barriers, mutexes, monitos


- functions to exchange messages between tasks


- software timer tasks



The project is linked to its own website: <http://www.rtos48.com/>. You can find the source code, a full documentation and tutorials to install, begin projects and learn how it works. 


The project is under the terms of the MIT licence.
