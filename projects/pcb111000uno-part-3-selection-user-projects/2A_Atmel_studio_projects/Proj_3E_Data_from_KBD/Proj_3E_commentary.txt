Proj_3E:  Leaving the mini-OS to deal with displaying the numbers 

The following project subroutines are introduced:

1. Num_from_KBD()	This requires a pointer to a string known in this case as "digits".	As the user presses keys the subroutine uses the numerical ones to populate the string.

2. I2C_Tx_8_byte_array()	Every time that a new numerical key press is made this subroutine is used to update the display.	It sends the "digits" string to the PCB_A device and the mini-OS displays it.

3. I2C_displayToNum()	When the user has finished entering the number and pressed the return key	this subroutine requests that the mini-OS convert the display to an actual number	and return it to the user program.

4. Num_to_PC()	This converts a number to a string of characters and sends them to the PC.
A basic discussion of converting numbers to strings and strings to numbers is given in	https://epdf.tips/c-programming-for-microcontrollers.html. 

A bit of arithmetic is also carried out to confirm that the operations of entering	and displaying data have been successful.
