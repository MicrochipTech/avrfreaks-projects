## Summary

** New alpha version!! Some bug fixes and an additional feature **


STK500 Control is a small delphi application that utilizes the STK500 command line software to access STK500 / AVRISP. Once set up it can be set in small mode and always on top, for easy access to the PROGRAM button while not in the way of any other windows. The program applies to users of compilers without a programming capablility of the STK500, which usually have to open AVR Studio to program the AVR.
