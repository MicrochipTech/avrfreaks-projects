User unit consist LCD display, encoders, and switch used to set up vacuum on/off values and hysteresis mode. Units connected with RS232, hot pluggable. Main unit stores maximum and minimum vacuum values in EEPROM, as well as it probes present vacuum approx. 5 times a second. Vacuum sensor is Freescale Semiconductor's MPX series.
