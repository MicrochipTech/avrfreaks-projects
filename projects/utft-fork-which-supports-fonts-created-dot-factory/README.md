## Summary

 


The UTFT library is a Universal Library for displaying content on a TFT with support for many drivers. I wasn't happy with the font support and it wasn't easy creating fonts that would work with the original UTFT library. With a little modification, I modified the library to also support fonts that were created with [The Dot Factory](http://www.eran.io/the-dot-factory-an-lcd-font-and-image-generator/).

Complete instructions on how to create the fonts and display them are documented in dfUTFTFork.pdf.
