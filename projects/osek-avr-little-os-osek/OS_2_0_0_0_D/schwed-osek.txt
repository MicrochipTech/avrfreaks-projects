SCHWED-OSEK 2.0 Draft
supported compilers: IAR,GCC,IMAGECRAFT,CODEVISION,(CROSSWORKS only with your help *)

Hi,
this is a little OS, like a small OSEK (OSEK: is a common RTOS for automotive apps.).

Focus of this OS is scheduling of cooperative and preemptive tasks without heavy stack usage.


MAIN FILES:

OS.C/OS.H      kernel and support functions
target.h       compiler and device specific stuff
Atmegaxxx.c    port to specific AVR device
ostypes.h      OS typedefinitions
task.c/h       user task definitions and profile
os_cnf.h       OS options:
               #define OS_USE_PREEMP_TASK_OPTION
                /* Preemptive tasks option is active */

               #define OS_USE_16BIT_TIMETABLE_OPTION
                /* tasks can be auto scheduled between 1ms..65535ms */
                /* otherwise scheduling is 8Bit-> 1ms..255ms */

               #define OS_USE_MAX_16TASKS_OPTION 
                /* A maximum of 16 tasks are possible */
                /* otherwise only 8 tasks are supported */
                
See please task.c how to define tasks and the options for.
Also task priority and preemp handling is explained task.c .
Included in this package is a port for ATmega8/16/32 running at 8Mhz. It is easy to migrate to other devices, because
you only have to define a timebase interrupt with 1ms occurrence.

Supported OSEK API:

TASK:             BCC1 type supported with TASK(x) definition
ACTIVATION:       In the task profile(e.g task.c) you can define tasks as auto scheduled (ms)
                  or as manual scheduled. Manual scheduled tasks are activated with API
                  ActivateTask(TASK_ID) 
TERMINATION:      Light termination supported.
                  --> last statement of a task must be TerminateTask()
                  or ChainTask(TASK_ID) which defines next task to be in ready state

Atomic:           SuspendAllInterrupts() -> disables interrupts
                  ResumeAllInterrupts()  -> enables interrupts
                  
TIME:             get time (ms) with GetStopWatch()

* I need feedback on crossworks compiler issue with sfrw access.
