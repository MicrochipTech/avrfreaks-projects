## Summary

MultiKit is a multi purpose development kit using AVR microcontrollers. It is targeted for anyone who wants to start learning AVR micros. The big thing about MultiKit is that it is also a fully featured Mixed Signal Oscilloscope with frequency analysis.


The MultiKit demonstrates:


- LCD Displays  

- Analog to Digital Converters  

- Accelerometers  

- RS-232 Interface & Xmodem file transfer  

- Multiplexing LEDs  

- Generating negative voltages  

- Reading multiple switches with a single pin  

- Multiple frequencies on a buzzer  

- Fast Fourier Transforms  

- Random numbers


These topics are demonstrated with 6 applications:


SCOPE: Fully featured Mixed Signal Oscilloscope with FFT  

BALL: Bouncy ball in a Labyrinth game with tilt control  

3D: Use accelerometer to change viewing angle of a sphere  

PIANO: Mini Piano with dual frequency output  

FRCTL: Fractal to demo simple math and random numbers  

RS232: RS-232 Terminal

Suggestions are appreciated!


*update: The ADXL311 has been discontinued so I will be working on a second revision for this project.
