## Summary

This tutorial describes the construction and programming of a basic pulse width modulator controlled linear current regulator for driving a LED at 500mA. Uses Attiny84, AVRStudio, AVRDragon and in circuit debugging.


See [http://www.forward.com.au/uCLedD...](http://www.forward.com.au/uCLedDriver/build_basic_uC_led_driver.html)  

for the tutorial and files.


No SMD devices are used.  

You can use this same basic design for supplying up to 5A or more by changing the current sense resistor.


Construction time 2hrs.
