## Summary

This is a IR remote control for a Sony TiVo and a Sony TV. It replicates the funcitons of the orig remote, but without the numeric keypad. It uses a matrixed 4x6 keypad. The AVR powers down between keypresses to conserve power as described in an AVR tech note. Schematics and source code are included along with a utility program I wrote to decode the Sony TiVo IR codes (I couldn't find them anywhere on the 'net). Not shown on the schematics but included in my remote is a Simple Programmer DB25 connector for updating the remote.
