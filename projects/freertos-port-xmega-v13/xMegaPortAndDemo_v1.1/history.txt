FreeRtos port for Atmel xMega CPUs.

Version 1.1.0
13-Feb-2011

- more stress in the demo code to get more testing depth.
- use simple context-switch routines if only level 0 is used, less overhead.
- Context switch doesn't store r2 - r17 anymore (portPRESERVE_R2R17	).
- The med-level and high-level ISRs may call the light weigth api (and make context switch, configMAX_SYSCALL_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY).
- Based on FreeRTOS 6.1.1
- Runs with xMega 32A4 and 128A1 (config24BITADDRESSING).
- Examples showing nesting interrupts (mid-level and high-level).
- Simpler, more elegant context switch macros.
- Demo code demonstrates medium- and low-level interrupts nesting each other
