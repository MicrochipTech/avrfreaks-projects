# Fuse restore ATtiny45

## Summary

Using as many I/O lines as possible on a small AVR like the ATtiny45 you need to fuse the RSTDISBL fuse bit to change the RESET line to a I/O line.  

Serial ISP programming is after that not possible any more.


To reset the fuse bit a simple hardware solution is possible. A other solution is to use a high voltage (12V) programmer.
