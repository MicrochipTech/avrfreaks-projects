## Summary

The project deals with the short range communication via IR signatures which otherwise are translated to binary codes. These codes are transmitted into the medium when the button (on a remote) is pressed, which when picked up by the receiver establishes a communication with the transmitter. A few rudimetry operations are assigned to each button on the remote e.g. if one button corresponds to the forward motion of the robot, other corresponds to the backward. Similar assignments for left and right movement of the robot are there for other buttons.


Thank you.
