## Summary

This is a small AT90S2313-project for the logic part of a radio beacon.


The attached sorce code enables the CPU to send a message of max. 127 char's in Morse code (CW). The message text is programmed into the CPU's eeprom. Before programming the CPU you must decide what CW speed you want and how long the pause (in seconds) before the message is repeated should be. NOTE! the speed is given as characters/min (characters/min. is approx. 5 * Words per minute).


Hardware schematics and a photo of the prototype is also attached.
