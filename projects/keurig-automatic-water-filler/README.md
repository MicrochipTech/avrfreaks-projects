# Keurig automatic water filler

Uploaded by hagenkaye on 2018-01-01 04:06:00 (rating 0 out of 5)

## Summary

A simple project using an ATtiny84 with a eTape water level sensor, 12V water solenoid, and some WS2812 RGB leds to indicate status.  Connected to the water line in the same fashion as an ice cube maker, this project fits inside the tank of a keurig coffee maker to automatically fill the tank when the water level drops.  No more filling the tank by hand!  Complete details, including schematic, code and pictures at github.
