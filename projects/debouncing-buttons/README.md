## Summary

Recently I faced a problem that gave me headaches. For an application I need to debounce 7 push buttons witch were connected on different ports. Searching the internet I found two ways to do this, namely: hardware method that involves an extra circuit and a software method that involves only code changes. Due to the fact that I'm not a hardware expert but also because I didn't want to further complicate the circuit I have chosen the software method.
