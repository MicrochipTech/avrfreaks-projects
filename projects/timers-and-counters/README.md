## Summary

While working on a project, i had to use timers an counters. So i tested it on my atmega32. i have given 8 codes which do different things. I have commented it. I have taken reference from [www.avrfreaks.net](https://www.avrfreaks.net). It will help to explore the use of timers in different modes.  

message me if any queries. Thanks
