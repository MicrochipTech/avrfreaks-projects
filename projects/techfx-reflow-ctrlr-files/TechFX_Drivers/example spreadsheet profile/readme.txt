excel spreadsheets for use with techFX reflow tools
___________________________________________________

Just a few notes for version 4.0


- there is nothing in the excell spreadsheet to distinguish the time units from seconds or minutes!
  that is located in the software, the two radio boxes "secs" or "mins". After loading spreadsheet,
  choose the time unit that is appropriate.

- read ahead value in techFX reflow tools v 4.0 should be set to zero when using "min" units.
  when using "secs" units, experimentation may yeild a good value around 13-15.
