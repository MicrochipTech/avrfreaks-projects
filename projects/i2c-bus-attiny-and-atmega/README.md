## Summary

This is an Instructable that contains I2C bus drivers for the ATtiny2313 and ATmega168. Although based on the Atmel Apps notes, these drivers are extended to include the capability to do multiple reads from memory devices and are thus complete I2C drivers. Complete, working examples are provided for both devices. 


Restrictions are 100KHz data rates, 1MHz clock for ATtiny and 4MHz clock for ATmega.


A pdf of the Instructable, all code and all schematics are now available on this sight.
