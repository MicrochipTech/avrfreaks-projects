Open Kubus is a open USB one time pad stick. The handling is very easy, a pc recognize Open Kubus as keyboard. Every time you press the button on the Open Kubus a one time pad occurs on the actual position of the cursor.


We use a crypto library for avr controllers, so you can build your on crypto stick. There is also a small tool to personalize the stick over usb (with libusb) and to lock the internal memories.
