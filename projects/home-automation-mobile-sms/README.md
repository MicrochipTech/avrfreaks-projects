## Summary

Hi, I am Yasir Karim Qureshi (Mehranian).


It is my Final Year Project which is submitted to my University (Mehran UET Jamshoro).  

A simple ATMega32 controller is used as central part which recieves sms from a Sony Ericsson mobile T610i. T610i is very simple and less expensive cell phone and its also very easy to connect with AVR Microcontroller.  

Over all project is not difficult and all the parts can easily be arranged.


If you have any questions, you can contact me through email.  

Best of luck.
