## Summary

I accidentally deleted this while messing with tags. This is a reposting.


When Circuit Cellar and Renesas sponsored a contest a few years ago, I got the free design kit but never got around to making an entry. Feeling guilty, I wrote this parody entry and submitted it.


Steve Ciarcia liked it, and offered me $100 to allow him to publish it on his web site with the "distinctive excellence" winners. I agreed, and he wisely withdrew it from the competition, well knowing it would not win.


Renesas hated it, and discouraged him from posting it, so it never saw the light of day. The check cleared, however.
