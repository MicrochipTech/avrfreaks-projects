## Summary

This Amazing Software Serial Library that works on most avr's and Tested on a ATTiny45 at 115200 baud but changing that is very easy!  

The library is composed of only 2 functions! And Written in a very readable way. anybody will be able quickly figure out what's going! and understand it! 


uartInit() setup the software uart  

sendByte(uint8\_t byte) send a byte through the software uart


The library uses timer 1 but that could be changed easly!


The settings are defined at the top of this amazing library's source code


This Amazing library is so amazingly fast you could make a logic analyzer with it! Seriously!


I made this because I couldn't find something fast and flexable, simple to understand with low memory usage supported on ATtiny series MCU's written in C!


Try this out! You will be instantly impressed!


I had fun writing this as you can see! :)


Have Fun, Jon
