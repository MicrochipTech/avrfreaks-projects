## Summary

This theme, very often topic in forum-posts was the basic to start a small demo "How to use this cards on SPI"  

Now older MMC-, MMC-, SD- and SDHC-cards are supported plus some "not 100% SD-compliant" SD-cards.  

used hardware: ATMega128 and some ARMs.


If anyone find a not-supported card, I'm very interested in this information (plus some details - if possible).
