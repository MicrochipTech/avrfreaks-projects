## Summary

***** UPDATED 2003-04-15 *** - optimized overall code, used PHP preprocessor**


Yes, you can play Manic Miner and over 70 good games on AVR connected to your VGA monitor and keyboard ! 


I do an emulator of Czechoslovak microcomputer PMD-85 originally based on famous INTEL 8080 processor. It consist of AVR **90S8515**, latch 74573, SRAM 64KB and 1 MB(2x29F040) Flash memory. Connection to display is provided by 8bit ISA VGA card from old PC. As keyboard uses standard PC-AT. VGA card display videoram in 640x480 resolution with 16 colours. Software for emulated machine is stored in 1 MB external FLASH memory pretend as tape. You can play many well-known games i.e. **Boulder Dash**, Tetris, Saboter, Raiders, **Manic Miner**, **Flappy**, Labyrithm, Willy ... or write own programs in BASIC-G or play another 76 games (some has 3D graphics), stored on monster FLASH. 


Some screenshots from Manic Miner game are at <http://www.kmit.sk/~peto/pmd85/manic1.php>.


More info about PMD-85 in English are [available here](http://www.schotek.cz/pmd/indexe.htm).  

I prepare new version emulator with only 3 IC with connection to TV, becauce this version is depended on old VGA cards which is hardly available hardware....
