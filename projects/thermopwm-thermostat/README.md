# ThermoPWM - Thermostat

## Summary

In this example we have a LCD display together with a DS1621 temperature sensor. The PWM duty cycle rises with temperature, and both temperature and duty cycle in percent are displayed. It will work like a fan controller in this specific example, but can be modified to any type of lamp, motor or fan regulator.


This was tested on a ATmega16, but all AVR with an Timer1 (PWM) should be able to do the work...  

It should also be easy to port to other C compilers...
