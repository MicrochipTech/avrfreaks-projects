# Analog Hatswitch (dual channel)

Uploaded by schwobaseggl on 2013-06-12 08:47:00 (rating 0 out of 5)

## Summary

This simple circuit acts as two-channel virtual potentiometer.  

It is intended as a supplement to a RC system, replacing two of the potentiometers with a digital up-down type hatswitch to be integrated in the RC systems Stick. I use it to control the pan/tilt servos of an FPV camera (video-piloted RC-aircraft).  

It uses an Attiny26 controller with minimum external circuitry.  

Supply: 5V (as supplied to many RC systems internal potentiometers), or use a Vreg (as depicted in the circuit)  

Output: 0-5V, 2.5V center, two channels  

Input: 5 keys (2x up, 2x down, 1x common center)


Details and a video can be found here (in German, sorry):

Basically many off-the-shelf digital potentiometers will do the same job
