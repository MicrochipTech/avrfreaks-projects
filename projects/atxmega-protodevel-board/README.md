## Summary

Xmegas have been typically out of the range of every day hobbyist AVR enthusiasts because they are only available in SMD components. This project builds a programming board that accepts an Xmega that you solder onto easily available carrier boards. Once programmed, you can detach the Xmega and use it in your designs.



See step by step instructions and get the Eagle schematic and board files from: <http://www.instructables.com/id/Build-an-AVR-Xmega-Prototyping-Board/> or download from link below.
