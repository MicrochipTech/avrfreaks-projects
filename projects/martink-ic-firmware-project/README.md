# MartinK IC Firmware Project

## Summary

This firmware project aims to make it easy to develop applications for small ICs like microcontrollers and socs. Using this code base you can easily access many different peripheral devices and easily build things like quadcopters, robots and other applications.


 


It is a highly configurable, portable and clean code base that provides many generic device drivers.  The design goal is a linux like alternative for really small microcontrollers that do not support much memory and have very tight constraints. You can reuse most of this code, fine tune it for your own needs, and port it to other socs (other than AVR).


 


Several other people have contributed with their code and therefore the code is licensed just like linux kernel: GPL. Add your drivers, write generic support for tiny chips and make this a highly portable alternative to linux for resource tight microcontroller embedded applications.
