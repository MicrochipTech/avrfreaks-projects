## Summary

ButterflyAlarm is a software project that allows you to use your Butterfly board as an alarm clock. You can download ringtones in the dataflash with the aid of a PC companion program (ButterflyConnect). In my website ([http://users.forthnet.gr/ath/kgi...](http://users.forthnet.gr/ath/kgiannak/)) you can find a detailed description of the code. The original ATMEL code and the corresponding GCC port are greatly refactored.


I have started a thread at the academy forum for discussing this project. It's located at:
