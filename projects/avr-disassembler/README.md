## Summary

After I understood how the AVR opcodes were built up, I wrote a disassembler that accepts AVR HEX files as input. I used the Mocka 0608m Modula-2 compiler with Linux.  

The disassembler is 'smart' in that it knows when to use clr, and, lsl rol etc. You can find the disassembler on my website at [http://fruttenboel.verhoeven272....](http://fruttenboel.verhoeven272.nl/AVR/avrdis.html) including all sources and target files.
