## Summary

The AVGA project - open source AVR based color video game development platform for single chip game console.


After almost two years, i returned to this project. Following many requests to release the AVR Super Mario source, i created a website:

This engine enables you to code a color, high resolution, smooth video game, like Super Mario Bros or Commander Keen on a mega AVR. All video processing is done by software in background using interrupts, with no external active components. You only need to connect the AVR to a color TV with RGB input. It is designed to occupy very little flash and to return the CPU to main program whenever it is just possible. Everything can be customized to meet your project needs.


Main features:


 * No external active components  

 * Interrupt driven  

 * 5 cycle pixel period  

 * 4 bits per pixel  

 * Overlay utility  

 * Advanced screen mapping  

 * Multi-directional scrolling  

 * Multi-video standard support  

 * High time and memory efficiency  

 * Part unspecific  

 * Highly customizable  

 * Open source (GNU/GPL)


New features in v0.2:


 * NTSC support  

 * double buffering  

 * bug fixes  

 * more optimizations in OVERLAY  

 * extended screen addressing  

 * sound support


All specs, source codes, schematics, complete API description etc. are on the project's web site.
