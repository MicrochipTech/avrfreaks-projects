## Summary

The movie "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" is a high school comedy from 1986. In the movie, there was a scene where Ferris's high school principle (Mr. Rooney) comes to Ferris's home and pushes the intercom button. Ferris should be at home sick, but he is out for a day, skipping school. So, Ferris hooked up an audio tape player to give automated responses to anyone who presses the intercom button.  

This project is an updated version using a serially controlled MP3 player and an attiny2313.  

The project is rather useless, but somewhat amusing.
