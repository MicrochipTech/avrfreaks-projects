This software was developed for a custom MP3 player board.

To get it working on the EVK1101 evaluation board, you need to solder/mount a header
on J19 (marked with LINE and GND on the board) and connect headphones to it. These boards
only have one filter, so the best you can do is to tie both the left and right headphone
input together to LINE. (giving dual mono.) The sound is also not especially loud; I suggest
reducing the size of R60 for higher volume. See page 7 of the schematics.

Apart from that, the code should work without any modifications as long as the BOARD symbol
is set to EVK1101 and the target MCU is UC3B0.
