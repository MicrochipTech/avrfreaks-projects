## Summary

Small footprint and minimalist hardware for a RF node system.  

A ATMEGA328, RFM12B, RS485, 6-pin ICP header. 2x20 pin footprint for micro pins/power/serial(from micro & from RS485)  

Addressable nodes, connect to one with a serial terminal to configure.  

Simple command line interpreter and lets you link to a remote node to configure it (frequency, node address, over-the-air data rate, node group)  

Configuration stored in EEprom  

19 channels in 0.5Mhz steps (for the 433Mhz version)  

11 over-air data rates (600bd to 115Kb)  

255 node addresses  

255 groups
