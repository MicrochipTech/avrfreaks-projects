# Simple ADC interface with LDR

## Summary

This is a "main.c" code to demonstrate ADC interface with LDR and display on 16x2 character LCD screen. This is intended for beginners hence I want to keep the code simple without LCD functions. I have used 4 bit LCD functions to display the value. Any library on the internet may be used for the LCD functions. An illumination source (flash light or torch) can be used to test the circuit in ambient lighting conditions.
