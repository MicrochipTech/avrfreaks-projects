## Summary

Generates modulated 60kHz carrier with time code information suitable for testing "atomic clock" (US) devices. A wire loop is connected to PD7 through a resistor and the clock being tested is placed inside the loop. 


Time automatically increments each minute. User can easily change starting date/time in program. 


Uses ATMega16 with 12MHz crystal. No external components required. Compiled with avr-gcc in AVR Studio 4. 


Tested with 2 different atomic clocks to verify correct operation. Comments welcome.
