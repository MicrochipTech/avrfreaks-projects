## Summary

On 24.10.2006 Holger Buss and Ingo Busker brought MK to live, a great community of Mikrokopter pilots. Already in the middle of 2007 the Mikrokopter hovered steadily, like a "airnail" and agile, like a bird, through the air. 


In a short time frame further components were added. By now it is even possible to run half-autonoumos flights. The Mikrokopter is strong; it can carry, for example, a camera or other sensors. For rmore sportive pilots the Mikrokopter offers enough agility to fly loops (over pitch and roll-axes).
