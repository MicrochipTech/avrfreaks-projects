.....ABOUT

The remote car alarm system consists of two modules: sender and receiver.
The sender module monitors car status and once in a while transmits status data 
on 433.91Mhz frequency. At emergency situations(which are toggled by sensors)
sender transmits status data and emergency codes more rapidly.

Thus the receiver module picks up status data and alerts car owner about current/last 
car status. At emergency situations it generates irritating sound to alert the car owner 
about possible threat.
