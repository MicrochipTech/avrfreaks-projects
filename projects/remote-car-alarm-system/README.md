## Summary

remote car alarm system. sends info about car stats to your pocket receiver  

the project consists of two parts:  

 1. sender [using avrasm2 from avrstudio4 on attiny15L]  

 2. receiver [using avr gnu-gcc on attiny26L or attiny15L using asm]


."HISTORY"  

**** sender pcb built using optocouplers, switching regulator, rx433 module turn-off circuit...  

**** sender tested with tiny26  

**** fryed all my tiny15 :) still testing receiver with tiny26  

**** sender and receiver part tested(receiver with ATmega16)  

**** sender part already built.  

**** receiver part already built


Right now i consider temperature stability of ATtiny15 internal RC oscillator. I think about moving to ATtiny26 driven by a watch crystal.


Any comments about the idea, the code or schematics is highly appreciated!
