MicroMenu provides an easy-to-use hierarchical menu interface for AVR firmware written in the C language. It was written as a way to teach myself linked-lists, and I've cleaned it up and made it freely available for both commercial and non-commercial uses. It is designed to be contained in a single user-made menu loop, with helper functions for each menu item (if desired).

Menus are stored completely in flash memory, saving SRAM.


#### SETUP: ####

  MicroMenu is designed to interface with your existing string output routines. This routine should be of type (void)(const char*), and should use PROGMEM strings. If your string routine uses SRAM strings instead, you can switch MicroMenu over to SRAM buffered mode via defining MENU_USE_SRAM_BUFFER at the top of the Menu.c file (alternatively in your makefile, passed to Menu.c via the -D switch).

  If used, MENU_USE_SRAM_BUFFER should be defined to the maximum string size. If a menu string exceeds this, a stack overflow will occur. Please ensure that MENU_USE_SRAM_BUFFER is of sufficient length - including the string's trailing null terminator - if used.



#### DEFINING MENUS: ####

  To create a menu, use the MAKE_MENU macro. This takes as arguments the following: 
     
     Name, Next, Previous, Parent, Sibling, SelectFunc, EnterFunc, Text

          Name:       Name of the menu. This is used when linking one menu to another, or to select a menu outright with the
                      SET_MENU macro.

          Next:       Name of the next menu item in the current menu list. If no menu exists, use the NULL_ENTRY constant.

          Previous:   Name of the previous menu item in the current list. If no menu exists, use the NULL_ENTRY constant.

          Parent:     Name of the current menu item's parent menu. If no menu exists, use the NULL_ENTRY constant.

          Sibling:    Name of the current menu item's sibling menu. If no menu exists, use the NULL_ENTRY constant.

          SelectFunc: Name of the function to execute when the menu item is selected. If no function exists, use the
                      NULL_FUNC constant.

          EnterFunc:  Name of the function to execute when the menu item is shown. If no function exists, use the NULL_FUNC
                      constant. This is executed AFTER the menu item's text string (if any) is shown, allowing menu string
                      modifications, or dynamic menu strings.

          Text:       Text string to show when the menu is displayed. This is static; if dynamic strings are required they
                      should be constructed in the menu item's EnterFunc function. If no static string is to be shown, use
                      the NULL_TEXT constant.

  If menus are to be referenced across C files, use the EXTERN_MENU macro. This takes as a parameter the name of the menu to be exported across C files. It is recommended that this be placed in the header file included the C file not containing the full menu definition.



#### INTERFACE: ####

  Before calling a menu, the macro SET_MENU_WRITE_FUNC should be used. This should take as a parameter the string output function name, of type (void)(const char*).

  To enter a menu, use the SET_MENU macro. This takes as a parameter, either a menu name OR a transversal of the current menu function (PREVIOUS, NEXT, PARENT or SIBLING).

  To execute the current menu's function, use the GO_MENU_FUNC macro. This takes as a parameter the desired current menu function, either ENTERFUNC or SELECTFUNC.
