## Summary

New HW for the USBasp able to program target device with VCC down to 3v.  

the Resistors on the output of the programmer and the protecting diodes  

in the target device limit the voltage to the VCC of the target  

and for the input to the programmer, the ATmega8 in the circuit see  

the voltage from 3 to 5V as a logic high
