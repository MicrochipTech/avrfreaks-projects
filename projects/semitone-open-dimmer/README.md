## Summary

The aim of this project is to develop standalone dimmers for home use with a bunch of features. Although being focused on standalone purposes, they have machine interfaces like DMX512.


Semitone Diamond: An advanced, very feature-rich 20 channel fading dimmer with character LCD, IR remote input, DMX512 interface, buttons, rotary encoder, and more. Phase angle control based. For 50 and 60 Hz mains.  

See screenshots of the LCD: <http://semitone.sf.net/diamond/>


Semitone Crystal: A simple one-channel fading dimmer with IR remote input, UART, push-button connector, 3 LED indicators. Phase angle control based. For 50 Hz mains only.
