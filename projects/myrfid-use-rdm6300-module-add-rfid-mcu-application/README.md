## Summary

Happy new year to everybody !


This is a small project (in the essence of my "project like design-note")


on adding RFID support with RDM6300 module to an MCU project.


Assembly code for validating the checksum of RFID tag is provided


from the retrieved data-stream and some details for connecting


a 2x16 LCD module,Â connection to PC-Serial and some other stuff...


ATtiny2313 is used, which is more than enough for this one...
