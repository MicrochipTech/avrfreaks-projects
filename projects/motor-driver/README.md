## Summary

This application runs a DC motor by means of pulse width modulation and is controlled by the Pc's serial port (UART). You are able to read the rpm's by a LED/photodiode system. The revolutions are displayed into an LCD and adujusted depending on the diviation from the desired Rpm's. I'm using this to run an experiment in the lab. This is my first microcontroller project, any comments are welcome.
