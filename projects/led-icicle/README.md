## Summary

Description:


This LED "icicle" is based on ATMega8515 microcontroller and made from mainly blue LEDs. This device can serve as Christmas present or New Year's ornament. The "icicle" can be transformed into a "candle" if to use red and yellow LEDs and to change accordingly its external design. As the body I used two fur-tree toys: transparent plastic icicle and one-half of the Christmas ball. LEDs are placed in the first and second placed the microcontroller board.
