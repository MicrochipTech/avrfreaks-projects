/**
 * \mainpage
 *
 * This application emulates the Production test which all XMEGA-A1 Xplained
 * boards are delivered with from factory.  You are using an adapted and
 * repackaged copy by valleyman on AVRFreaks.
 *
 * Further, it shows how to use some of the functionality in the AVR Software
 * Framework found at http://asf.atmel.no.
 *
 * This application is a Memory game, in which the user must press the board
 * buttons in the same sequence in which their corresponding LEDs have lit up.
 * The game plays back samples or tones, depending on the game configuration,
 * via DAC and onboard speaker when buttons are pressed or LED sequences are
 * played.
 *
 * A sequence of button presses must be recorded before the game can start, and
 * the board will show running LEDs while waiting for the user to enter such a
 * sequence. The running LEDs indicate the timeout before the button press
 * sequence is saved to EEPROM and the game is started. If the user does not
 * press any buttons before the timeout, the application will simply restart the
 * process.
 *
 * The game can be configured at startup by means of two jumpers:
 * - by connecting \ref GAMEMODE_SENSE_PIN to \ref GAMEMODE_GROUND_PIN, the
 * board will try to load a button press sequence from EEPROM and start the game
 * of Memory, assuming valid game data could be found.
 * - by connecting \ref SOUNDMODE_SENSE_PIN and \ref SOUNDMODE_GROUND_PIN, the
 * application is configured to play notes from the chromatic scale, starting at
 * an A of 441Hz, instead of the sound samples.
 *
 * For more information on the various drivers included in ASF, see the website,
 * where documentation and code examples detailing each driver and service can
 * be found.
 *
 * \section Configuration
 * Some board-specific configurations and definitions are required for this
 * application. These are contained in \ref conf_example.h.
