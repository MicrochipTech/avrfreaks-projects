# XMEGA Demo for Xplain

## Summary

This is another repackage project for my learning about AVR using the Xplain (green) board. The original package, AVR1927, includes the boot loader, USB-USART bridge and a demo application shipped with XMEGA A1 Xplained (blue) board. The application is a memory game, more sophisticated than the gaily flashing LED demo shipped with Xplain board.


This package contains only the game. It is tested under AVR Studio 5. AS5 is not an option in Freaks projects section yet, so I'm anchoring this under WinAVR. (AS5 projects won't work under AS4 or AS3.) I believe that the make file under Debug directory should work for WinAVR.


All rights remains with Atmel, and so on, and so on.
