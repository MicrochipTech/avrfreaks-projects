## Summary

Serial ports are great when you need to debug a microcontroller or when connecting peripheral devices. This project is based on the fact that sometimes you need more serial ports (COM). Also some computers today come without a COM port because COM and LPT (parallel) ports are seen as legacy (out-of-date) devices. To alleviate this problem, this document will show you how to create a “virtual” serial port a USB port. This article will show you how to use a “virtual” COM port running via a physical USB port.
