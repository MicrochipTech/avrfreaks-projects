Spark Loader is a boot loader for AVR microcontrollers, it is used for programming both flash and EEPROM using a serial link between your computer and the microcontroller through any free COM port. Spark loader consists of two parts:


 1. On - chip boot loader:  

 A hex file that resides at the boot section of the flash memory.


 2. Windows application :  

 It has the responsibility of transmitting flash and EEPROM data into the microcontroller.
