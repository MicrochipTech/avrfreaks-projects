# TWI/I2C On An Arduino (Atmega8 a

## Summary

This is a simple project demonstrating how to get TWI/I2C running on an Arduino (Atmega8 and Atmega168). It shows how use of an external library makes the coding simple and legible. It also shows a few tricks for getting TWI to run properly on the Arduino "Mini" (Atmega168). The project interfaces the Arduino to the LIS3LV02DQ 3-axis accelerometer.


The Arduino is a great platform for prototyping designs and learning more about the Atmel microcontrollers, especially for newbies and beginners to electronics.
