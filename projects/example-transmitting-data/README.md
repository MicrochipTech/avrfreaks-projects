## Summary

These project will shows the example of Transmitting data between the UART for ATMEGA128. The simulation is design in proteus professional. Type keyboard keys in Virtual Terminal showing Transmitting, and Automatically the data is receiving in Virtual terminal written Receiving. 


These example will help you to design GPS with GSM tracking Project.


The UART.c and UART.h is the file consist of all the definition of AVR microcontroller UART communication. Some of the higher end micro-controller will not be available, so in UART.c add the definition by following the same example , you will be able to use the UART.c with any AVR Controller.


HAVE A NICE TIME...  

Happy Programming
