# Interrupt driven RC5 IR library

Uploaded by willemj on 2003-11-07 16:56:00 (rating 0 out of 5)

## Summary

A library for receiving RC5 remote codes but interrupt driven instead of using polling. No more polling needed! Downside is the use of a (8-bit) timer and an external interrupt (of course). Written for at90s8515 on STK500 but easily ported. Code includes extensive description/comments. Demo program showing the usage is included.
