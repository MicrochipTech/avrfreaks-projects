## Summary

This is a project that is not finished yet - as if it would ever be.


Testing a vacuum tube is a very demanding thing to do. One has to handle anode voltages ranging from only few volts up to a kilovolt class. And this should be done safely and measuring the currents as well.


On the other hand the filament can have voltages ranging from 1.2V to 200V. The current can varsy from a few mA up to 10A. Designing a supply that can handle that is a task by itself. Making a microcontroller to steer it is another.


This is my humble try to get all this done and after all have some fun with it.


The project files will keep on changing as the project advances.
