VS1011e.asm is a small program to quickly test the operation of a 
vs1011e MP3 decoder. The program plays a womans voice saying "hi"
every two seconds.

I am using a Sparkfun Breakout Board found here:

http://www.sparkfun.com/products/8819

Breakout Board for VS1011E-L MP3
sku: BOB-08819

I am running an atmega8515L running at 3V so there is no need for
a logic level converter. The Sparkfun board has a 3V regulator on board
therfore the board requires 5 Volts.

Here are the properties pertaining to the MP3 format I used 
in this program:

Complete name                    : C:\MP3Files\hi.mp3
Format                           : MPEG Audio
File size                        : 1.83 KiB
Duration                         : 936ms
Overall bit rate                 : 16.0 Kbps
Writing library                  : LAME3.82

Audio
Format                           : MPEG Audio
Format version                   : Version 2
Format profile                   : Layer 3
Duration                         : 936ms
Bit rate mode                    : Constant
Bit rate                         : 16.0 Kbps
Channel(s)                       : 1 channel
Sampling rate                    : 16.0 KHz
Stream size                      : 1.83 KiB (100%)
Writing library                  : LAME3.82

I use nch wavepad to convert the files.
Next I convert the mp3 file to text (in a format that avrasm will understand)
using the convert.exe included with this zip file.

usage is: convert mp3file.mp3 mp3file.inc

or you can just run the bat file supplied.

Connecting the sparkfun board to the atmega:

;the program uses PORTB
.equ	DREQ	= 1	;PB1 (input) connect to DREQ on sparkfun board
.equ	xDCS  = 2	;PB2 connect to BSYNC on sparkfun board
.equ	XRESET= 3	;PB3 connect to RST on sparkfun board
.equ	xCS   = 4	;PB4 connect to CS on sparkfun board
.equ	MOSI	= 5	;PB5 connect to SI on sparkfun board
.equ	MISO	= 6	;PB6 (input) connect to SO on sparkfun board
.equ	SCK	= 7	;PB7 connect to SCLK on sparkfun board
;
;other connections needed to Sparkfun board:
;GND, 5V .

;connect Left,right and GBUF(gnd) to a stereo audio jack
;from there you can plug in an amplified speaker (PC speaker works good)
;or some headphones
