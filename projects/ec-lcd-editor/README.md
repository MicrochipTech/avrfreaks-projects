## Summary

This project is still WAY in beta. But the basic idea is that you can use it to create and edit B&W LCD displays. Features the ability to add/edit any type of tool for your project (including drawing tools, exporters, importers, ect...). The scripts are done in PHP v5.x and thus any PHP extension can be added to support new features.
