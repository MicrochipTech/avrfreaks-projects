## Summary

Firmware for an LED Sign with scrolling text for an AVR microcontroller. The microcontroller controls multiple rows and columns of LEDs to display text. The hand generated font is 5x8 bits, and the LED matrix is 5x17 LEDs.


The [source code](https://code.google.com/p/ledsigncontroller/) is written in C for portability using a hardware abstraction layer method.


The hardware schematic and PCB were designed using [Eagle CAD](https://code.google.com/p/ledsigncontroller/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fhardware), and the LED matrix was simply LEDs pushed through cardboard and hand soldered.
