# Simple 2313 programming board

## Summary

Instead of having to wire up the programming wires every time I wanted to program my AVR, I decided to make a board designed to program my 2313 quick and easy. There is a link to the pictures below. Not bad for my first PCB etching and real soldering attempts. The leads for the AVR socket are long enough to insert into a breadboard while programming. This same design can be used for almost any other DIL AVR. Thanks goes to the AVR Freaks members as I could not have done this without them.


NOTE: I made an error when designing the PCB. The Reset line accidently went to PD6, so the PCB in the picture is misleading (even though I fixed the problem). The current .brd PCB below is correct now though.
