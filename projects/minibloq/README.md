## Summary

Minibloq is a graphical programming environment for Arduinoâ„¢, physical computing devices and robots. It's designed to be used specially by kids and beginners and currently supports most Arduino boards, DuinoBot (ATMega32U4), some Maple boards (preliminary) and ATTiny24/45 and 85 MCUs. You can download it freely from <http://minibloq.org> 


The sources will be available once we finish some key features.


Minibloq runs under Windows (XP, Vista, Seven) and has been tested succesfully under different Linux distros with Wine. Native Linux versions are under development as well as a future Mac OS X version (currently there is a WineSkin wrapper to run it in Mac).
