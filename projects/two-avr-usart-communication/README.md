## Summary

This is a basic program I put together to communicate data serially through USART between two AVRs. I wanted to test USART functionality on the AVR. 


The program will send data from a transmitter AVR to a receiving AVR, which in turn will display that data on the LCD. The data cycles through numbers 0-9 to be transmitted. The receiving AVR is utilizing the USART RX interrupt to process data received.
