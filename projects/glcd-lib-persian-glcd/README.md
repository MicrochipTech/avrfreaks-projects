## Summary

Hi dear friends  

Tazky to work to build graphics library and the same evening were all about 30 minutes ago  

Ù…ÛŒØ®ÙˆØ§Ù… I put it to friends provided perhaps the way to solving Mshklatshvn Ø¨Ø§Ø´Ù‡  

But this only Ktabkhvnh Mjanyh! That is not free, in fact, much to handle was all the same logic should not mirror Svrssh Sadgya I'm lost  

This Ktabkhvnh pain that you Avnayy Mykhvrh Kdvyzhn Mynvysn program!  

Now I say Bzaryd efficacy facilities  

 The most important thing for checkout Ram Ù‡Ø³ØªØ´ graphic LCD 128 * 64 KB of RAM one needs to be run on any atmega 16,32,64,128 Mykrvyy had two kilograms RAM Okay, well now that this question Ù…ÛŒØ¢Ø¯ Why use all the RAM Ø¨Ø´Ù‡  

I look good I can see the functionality Bndaryd plaster or not:  

1. Extra speed (using the buffer graphics card such as (In fact, all RAM card ÙˆØ§Ø³Ù‡ Grafykh))  

2. Draw line  

3. Draw hollow box  

4. Draw Bold box  

5. Support Chydan left to right and right to left (RTL, LTR)  

6. Put pixels on the page  

7. Remove pixels of Page  

8. One post in each coordinate with the desired speed (for example, you will post within 5 and 5 is the draw page)  

9. By using a function GBFputs The Farsi and write English (written language function to automatically detect it)  

I suggest you download and sample programs written with it Ktabkhvnh site is not unpleasant  

This is also the experimental Ktabkhvnh maybe if all forms Ø¨Ø§Ø´Ù‡ had any problems contact me. (Mshkhsatm your ZIP file is)  

Thanks Mohammad farms
