## Summary

This is really more of a machining/packaging project than electronics, but there is an ATTiny13V at the heart of the controller. This is a Bike Light that uses a high-output 3-LED module, an AVR to watch the sole user interface device - a pushbutton, and a 18V Makita Li-Ion battery pack.


Source code is presented here, while a full AutoCAD solid model of the machined parts, and Eagle files for the circuit board are available on the projects website:
