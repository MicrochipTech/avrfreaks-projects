# Build a serial controlled LCD

Uploaded by emklaus on 2012-02-21 00:41:00 (rating 5 out of 5)

## Summary

This project creates an LCD module that accepts TTL level serial data  

or TWI (iC2) data as input and displays it on the LCD.  

Useful for microcontroller development projects as the display needs only  

power and a single serial data input line to use as a display.  

It uses LCD code contributed by Peter Fleury and TWI code by Donald R. Blake.  

The attached file contains source code, schematic and (ugh)photos of my project.
