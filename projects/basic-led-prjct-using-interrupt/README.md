## Summary

This project was developed to help get myself familiar with the AVR microcontroller architecture. I used the ATtiny25.


The code lights up a series of three LEDs based on the number of times a user presses a push-button switch. One LED is illuminated on the first press, two LEDs are illuminated on the second press, three LEDs are illuminated on the third press, and on the fourth press all of the LEDs are turned off.


The External Interrupt Request 0 was used to trigger the LED illumination sequence.


Pictures of the hardware setup, and a rudimentary circuit diagram are included in the .zip file.
