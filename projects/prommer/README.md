## Summary

This program is for flashing Atmel Mega series MCs over SPI-interface (serial programming feature) from the PCs LPT-Port. The MC is directly connected to the PCs Printerport without any additional hardware or powersupply. The software I provide is seperatly written for windows and linux.


(NOW COMPLETE!)


This can only work under the following circumstances:  

- MC has SPI Interface (MOSI,MISO and SCK-Lines) and serial flash download  

- Printerports current is sufficient for flashing (MC may not use more than 75mA)  

- given internal Oscilator and selected by CLKSEL (Default on most mega-MCs)


The software was written and proven to work for AT-Mega 8. I am sure can also work for other MCs with Serial-Programming-Feature.


Caution:  

I can not be held reliable for any damage this Software/hardware may cause to you. You make use of the information I provide in this project, completly on your own risk.
