## Summary

 I am working on building submersible data loggers, and this is my first (and definitely the simplest) version. Definitely a project for if you are starting out. If not, you will probably get annoyed by the detailed instructions... The main components necessary are an an analog accelerometer, the uLog from Sparkfun, an AVR programmer, and a battery. The finished product is a miniature accelerometer data logger with a programmable logging frequency that can log for 22hrs at a rate of 5Hz. The complete instructions are at:

 The next project will be waterproofing the data logger to 1,000m. The program files as well as a python script to view the data can be viewed at:
