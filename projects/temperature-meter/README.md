## Summary

A thermometer with an analogue instrument. The temperature is measured with a DS18S20 sensor. It has memory for max/min temperature. Pressing the button once makes the instrument show the highest measured temperature and wait for one second, then it falls to the lowest measured temperature waits for one second, then it shows the current temperature again. I use a Mega 8 with PWM output for the instrument.
