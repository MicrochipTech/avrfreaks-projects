## Summary

This project includes two modules: a receiver and a transmitter. The transmitter module is controlled using a 4-position key switch and an LED pushbutton. The key-switch turns the transmitter module on and also selects the power level for the water gun. The pushbutton is the trigger that activates the water gun. When the pushbutton is pressed, the position of the key-switch is read and a data packet is sent to the receiver module. The receiver translates the data and turns on a electric fuel pump. PWM is used to drive the electric fuel pump at varying levels of power. The electric fuel pump pumps water out of a reservoir and through a hose. Together the transmitter and receiver modules make a remote control water gun.
