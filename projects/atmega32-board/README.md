## Summary

I built a SINGLE SIDED DEV board for ATMEGA32 with a lot of features


LCD (compatible code vision)  

4 buttons  

4 LED  

SERIAL COM  

ISP  

JTAG


All I/O PORT available


If you have any suggestion to improve it contact me 


There is a little mistake in the schematics , if you want to use it with code vision make sure the R/W pin of the LCD is connected to PB1


2nd mistake : don't connect the LCD while programming the ATMEGA !
