# Tankless Waterheater Controller

## Summary

I bought a tankless water heater from Amazon. It makes ample hot water.  

 But... I was disappointed with its ineffective temperature regulation. If I turned down the flow it would get hotter! When I turned up the flow: brrr cold!


That's the opposite of what you want in the shower for example.


Why doesn't it automatically increase or decrease the flame according to the flow?


My fix:  

I'll use the AVR Butterfly I have on hand to control a servo that will adjust the gas valve. The Butterfly will adjust the servo according to readings from sensors that sense water flow rate and inlet and outlet temperatures.
