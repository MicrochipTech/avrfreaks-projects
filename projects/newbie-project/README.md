## Summary

This is the most lowtech and straightforward project so far at AVRfreaks. When I started to program the AVR i looked for a very easy program just to get me started. All the programs I found was a bit too hard to just look at and understand right away. This project is exactly that (at least I hope so).  

The project is based around the 8515, 8 buttons and 8 LEDs.  

Once you press a button, a LED turns on.


I hope this can help you getting started. /Anders
