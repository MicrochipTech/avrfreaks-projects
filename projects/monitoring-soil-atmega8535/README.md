## Summary

The project comprises a system that automatically monitors in real time the essential parameters of the soil, so as provide for a proper growth of plants. the system is controlled by a microcontroller in this especific case an Atmega8535.  

The microcontroller gets as input signals provided by the sensors placed in the soil, and collects signals that correspond to the variations in parameters indicated by the variation of electrical signal at regular intervals, compares them with the benchmarking values stipulated for each parameter and the message corresponding to each action to be taken is displayed through a LCD and LEDs
