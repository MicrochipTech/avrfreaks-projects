# Simple Jeti voltage sensor

## Summary

This is a simple implementation of a sensor for the Jeti Duplex radio control system. It monitors two voltages (e.g. battery and BEC Bus) and displays the values on the jeti box. Can be hooked to any jeti duplex receiver. Contains a hard-wired low-voltage warning (edit source to adjust desired level) and can be used as a basis for the development of your own sensors. This is the initial "text only" protocol of Jeti, not the extended Duplex EX protocol. I have added the minimum hardware description - it might be reasonable to add the usual capacitors in a few places ;) It seems to work OK on the internal 4MHz RC osc.
