# Christmas Wreath Dazzler

## Summary

This Code is based upon the Atmel AVR. I created this code to interface with a simple hardware board. This will randomly blink 8 LED's. The time off for each LED is also random, making for a nice dazzling effect on an outdoor Christmas wreath. If anyone wants the hardware, Let me know and I will send plans.
