## Summary

I have for a long time wanted to try to develop something for a MCU and when I was building an UV box for PCB development I decided to create a timer for that using an Atmel MCU.  

First I created my own testboard with buttons, LEDs, display, PSU and a board with a Mega16 MCU.  

On this I developped the timer that is described with the pictures.


I have to say that this is my first project with an MCU so improvements are likely to be needed - but it works as it is and I will now go to work on a PCB for the project.


Comments and questions are welcome.
