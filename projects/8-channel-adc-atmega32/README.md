# 8-Channel ADC with Atmega32

Uploaded by DHARMANI on 2008-11-23 10:14:00 (rating 0 out of 5)

## Summary

The project uses ATmega32 with a push-button and 16x2 LCD for displaying the volatage value present at the ADC pins.  

At a time one channel value gets diplayed on the LCD. Pressing the push-button displays the next channel value. Similarly, all the channels can be viewed one by one by pressing the push-button. Channels count will roll back to channel-0 after displaying channel-7.  

The schematic and complete code along with the HEX file can be downloaded from here:
