## Summary

This is an introduction to the Open Source DC Servo project I'm working on.


The software is written to be as portable and extendable as possible.  

The PIV loop is implemented in GCC on a Mega328.  

And the encoder read is an inline assembly function.  

It will also include a hardware reference.


A tuning program is being developed in Processing for visual feedback.


The test platform, current hardware and tuning output graph can be found here: <http://n0m1.com/2011/12/31/dc-servo-in-a-state-of-motion/>


Updates will appear as progress continues...
