27.05.2006
New functionality for waiting for UART events:
UART_wait_RX, UART_sleep_RX, UART_wait_TX_empty, UART_sleep_TX_empty.
Documentation update.
Use only C99 types with explicite bit length.
Examples rewrite (thanks to Filipe Bernardino Pereira).
Dropped support for the avr-libc earlier than 1.4.0.
Version 3.0 released.

27.02.2006
Fixed bug with mispelled interrupt handler for second USART  (thanks to Markus Sokoll).
Support for new avr-libc.
New devices added.
Version 2.10 released.

03.12.2004
Fixed bug with bit access for SFRs in extended IO.
Version 2.01 released.

01.06.2004
Version 2.0 released.
Added support for USART devices.
Changed names of some functions (sorry for that).
Fixed bug which cased that there was not used one byte in TX buffer.
Added loopback test.

15.10.2003
Version 1.1.1 released
Added ability to specify TX and RX buffer lenghts separately (thanks to 
Günther Klement).

16.05.2003
Version 1.1 released

15.05.2003
Added function UART_get and UART_put for easy integration with standard IO
(can be used as fdevopen parameters)

13.05.2003
Changed agorithm for ring buffer implementation - now there are two pinters
head and tail
Because above new functions UART_get_RX_len and UART_get_TX_len was added to
calculate buffers content length.

12.05.2003
Corrected bug with handling the second transmitting character (thanks to Tomas
Modéer) - previous code does not take care about UDR double buffering
