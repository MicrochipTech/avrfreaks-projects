## Summary

this is the code to use the Ping Parallax sonar sensor with Atmega128. in this code, ICP1 is used to read how long the echo feedback is. after that, PWM1B is used to output a pulse with the same duration as that of the echo feedback. this is to test if the ICP1 is working properly.


please go to this link to get the code or the txt file of the code. the site somehow does not let me upload the file.
