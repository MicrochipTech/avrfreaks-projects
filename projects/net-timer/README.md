## Summary

Just a little hardware to be used for stopwatches, timing, clocks, light dimming etc. Very simple circuit! Just four little components added to your supply! The code I did not include here, but I'm sure every expert and beginner can come up with something... show me ;) 


The schematic is made with Orcad Capture lite, you'll probably need this or a supported viewer.  

(There's also a printout included)


For questions, try mailing [benadski@hotmail.com](mailto:benadski@hotmail.com)


PS: Don't forget to enable the internal pullup! (or use an external one)
