The nRF2401 code consists primarily of four files: nrf2401.c, nrf2401.h,
nrf2401_hw.h and nrf2401_config_bits.h.  Additionally, spin_delay.h is
required for some basic timing functionality in nrf2401.c.

Included also is a basic test program, nrf2401_serial_test.c.  This can be
compiled and linked against the library code to produce an image which will
continuously broadcast packets and print any packets it receives.

To compile the test program for an atmega168 running at 16mhz, in most
situations you can just type "make" in the directory (assuming you have
AVR GCC installed, configured, and in the current path).  You can just 
use "make nrf2401.o" to make the object file to link against your own projects.
Note that I've not set up makefile rules to detect changes in most files,
so you should do a "make clean" any time you make changes, if you decide to
use this makefile.

Note: Configuration for pin connections, etc. should be done int nrf2401_hw.h.
This file defines hardware-specific parameters for the library files.  Also
note that the CPU frequency is passed in on the compile line with 
-DMCU_CLK=<speed in hz>

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

thanks!
