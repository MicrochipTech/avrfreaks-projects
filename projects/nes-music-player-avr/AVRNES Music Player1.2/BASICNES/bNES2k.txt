1. Introduction

Been a long time, over a year since the last release of basicNES at
v1.4. I can't remember all that is new in this version, so please just
try to enjoy it! ;)

There are a great # of bugs which I need to get around to fixing. Help
me out by e-mailing me at the address below. Thanx!

------------

Open File Dialog courtesy of Matthew Leverton.

Much Mapper design and implementation is courtesy of DarcNES and
Pretendo, thanks to both nyef and Delta for the information regarding
it.

Line-based renderer proposed by Lothos_ and coded by me. Then re-coded for
speed by David Finch.

Palette ideas from the FCE source, originally by Bero.

No    more    source    code.

2. What it does(so far)

So far basicNES emulates the following NES hardware:
====================================================
Custom 6502 CPU
2KB of NES RAM
Regs $2000-2007
Joypad 1($4016)
Line Based Renderer(slower but more accurate). Now partial tilebased renderer as well.
8x8 and 8x16 sprites
Frame Skipping
Save/Restore states[Not compatible with other emus]
Palette(95%, some bugs) Palette is loaded from a .pal file
Mappers full/partial: 0,1,2,3,4,6,7,9,10,11,13,15,16,19,22,23,32,33,34,40,64,65,66,68,69,71,78,91
Partial sound using midi.
Motion Blur
Eagle-like engine for smoothing graphics
Scroll Fixes
Key Config
If a game contains SRAM($6000-$7FFF) the emulator will write a file to romname.wrm.
will add more soon.

3. How to use it

Well, just click File->Open and select a rom, and it will auto start.
If a game won't show graphics, try turning off 'new scroll code' under Emulation.

4. Controls

Joypad 1 is supported.
All keys are configurable in Emulation->Configure Keys. Saves to a file named bNES.cfg.
