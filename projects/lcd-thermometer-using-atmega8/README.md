## Summary

I decided to build a simple thermometer using my new LCD. The finished product ended up turning out really nice. The triple unit thermometer supports Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin. Each unit is selected by a pushbutton. Readings are averaged to ensure a more accurate reading. When you build this, you may have to tweak with the equations. You also need to add the floating point version of printf. The EAGLE .sch file and the source is attached. There is also a video of the thermometer on YouTube attached. PM me if you have any questions. Good Luck!
