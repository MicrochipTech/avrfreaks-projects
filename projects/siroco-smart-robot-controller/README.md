# SIROCO Smart Robot Controller

Uploaded by admin on 2003-10-07 17:20:00 (rating 0 out of 5)

## Summary

A project using an AVR 8535.


Through the serial port you can read easily all inputs and set any outputs of the controller.


There is also a simple Script Interpreter inside to RUN little scripts.


Resource Avalable :  

One RS232  

One I2C Master  

8 Analog Inputs ( 5 Volt )  

8 Digital Inputs ( 5 Volt )  

2 Interrupts Inputs with Counters ( 5 Volt ).  

2 Motors outputs with SPEED and DIRECTION Control ( 1 A 5.. 25 Volt )  

4 Power outputs ( 1 A 5..25 Volt )  

4 Servo outputs  

One Infrared Receiver  

One Infrared Transmiter ( with oscillator )


The idea is to use these card with a Pocket PC to drive a little robot.


The program can be use on any 8535 card with a serial port.


13/10 Add a new version of SRC + the ASM file if you do not have the Compiler  

24/10 I will soon add the Pocket PC Program to drive the board
