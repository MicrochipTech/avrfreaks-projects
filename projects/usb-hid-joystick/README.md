## Summary

Yet another (successful) conversion of an analog joystick to a USB version. A CH Flightstick Pro joystick (4 buttons, throttle) was converted to USB using an AT90USB162 MCU.  

The project firmware was created and compiled using AVR Studio 4. The project is written entirely in assembler. All the project files, as well as a schematic, are included in the ZIP file.  

This web site provided a lot of help while developing the joystick firmware, so this is my way of giving back to the community, and hopefully this project can be of help to someone else.


Happy coding!
