## Summary

We needed a set of 4 digit LED displays for our solar car  and found the 4 Digit Presetable Counter from Ozitronics which used an AT90S1200 AVR to drive the display. A bit of reporgramming and we had our displays working so that all four could be driven from one I/O line using a simple protocol. The displays handle numbers from -999 to 9999, variable decimal point and digital brightness control. Hardware modification, assembly code for the displays and example code in C & Basic is included.
