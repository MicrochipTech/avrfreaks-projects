## Summary

A software library for sending and receiving DMX packages by using a built-in serial port interface. By using the serial interface hardware of the Arduino processor to send the serial packages defined in the DMX protocol there is no need for time-critical assembler programming. There are also some advanced topics covered about using interrupts of the serial port.
