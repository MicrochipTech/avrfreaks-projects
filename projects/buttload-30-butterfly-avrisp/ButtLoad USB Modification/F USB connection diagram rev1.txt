Notes:

There are no pin-numbers in the schematic: i did this on purpose to prevent errors in case you use a different package for the FT232. Use DS_FT232R_v104.pdf to find the pin-numbers for your specific package.

There are more ways to connect the FT232 to the Butterfly. I tested several configurations, and the suggested connection-method here, turned out to be the simplest and best way to do it.
In order to connect the FT232 to the UART-connector of the ButterFly (BF), it is necessary to modify the quasi-RS232-interface on the BF. 
It's just a minor one. Short C300 on the rear of the BF. See "BLBF mod Assy.jpg"

The 1k resistors in the lines between FT232 and BF can be left out ... if you are very confident.
I prefer to put them in ... in case of a mistake (and who doesn't make mistakes ?), it will prevent damage to the hardware.

For convenience you can add a reset-push-button between J403 pin 5 and pin 6
