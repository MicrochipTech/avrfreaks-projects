VID = Vendor ID
PID = Product ID


To make USB-BLBF unique in your PC, it is necessary to change the VID and PID.

For this purpose I grant the use of VID=16C0 and PID=058B for the USB-version of ButtLoad Butterfly. You may NOT use it for other purposes.


< I bought a range of PID's for personal use, and wish to share this one >
