rev1: corrected 

BLBF = ButtLoad ButterFly
USB-BLBF = USB-version of BLBF
VID = Vendor ID
PID = Product ID



START

Do not connect anything yet !

For WindowsXP:

1. run CDM_Setup; it will install the standard drivers IN SILENT MODE !! No feedback on the screen during install ... so be patient ... after a few seconds it will say "Drivers succesfully installed"
2. run MProg2.8_Setup ... this will install Mprog which will enable you to modify the eeprom IN the FT232, to suit our needs
3. Plug in USB-BLBF. It should be recognized as a standard FTDI USB serial device.


Now you have to make a choice: 
You either customize BLBF and these drivers, to make them unique amongst other FT232-devices (I use several FT232's, so I prefer BLBF to be unique, which it is ... ;) now continu at Unique
or
you consider BLBF to be a standard PC-peripheral; Continu at Universal

Universal:
Run Mprog2.8a
Select Tools, Read and Parse ... the FT232-settings are read
Un-select "Only Program Blank Devices", at the bottom of the window
Select Invert Txd, select Invert Rxd, at the right
Choose File, Save As ... , and store these settings with the unique name MyButtload in this Buttload USB Package folder
Choose Device, Program

Exit Mprog2.8a
Done

Unique:
Run Mprog2.8a
Select Tools, Read and Parse ... the FT232-settings are read
Choose File, Open, and select Buttload.ept that can be found in Buttload USB Package folder (where this text is as well ...)
Choose Device, Program
Note that VID has changed to 16C0 and PID has changed to 058B

Exit Mprog2.8a
Disconnect USB-BLBF from the PC, wait a few moments, and re-connect.
Windows will come up with the "New Hardware Found message"
Note that Buttload is in the name ...
Select radio-button "Select from a list or specific location"
click Next
Make Windows look for the best driver, BUT tell it to look in the location where Buttload USB Package folder is on your PC, and
select MyBL_CDM2.00.00 folder
click OK
click Next
Let the wizard search .... it will complain that the driver is not certified etc.
Select Continue Anyway (these drivers are OK, the message pops up because VID and PID have changed)
Press Finish
Windows pops up with New Hardware Found again .... New Serial Port found
Same procedure .. Select radio-button "Select from a list or specific location"
click Next
The search-path will still be the same as in the previou ssection
Press Next
Again the alert ... 
Select Continue Anyway
Press Finish

Done

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To program BLBF with the ButtLoad-program, USB-BLBF needs to be enumerated as a ComPort in the range 1 - 4. This is not a limitation of BLBF or the drivers, it's a limitation in AVRProg. We'll get back later on that.
For the USE of BLBF and USB-BLBF as AVRISP, the Com-number can be beyond this range.

Now choose Start, Control Panel, System, tab Hardware, choose Device Manager, expand Ports(Com & Lpt), find Buttload, and see if it is within range 1 - 4.
OK? Then continue to the next section ..
Not OK? Double click Buttload's Com, tab Port Settings, click Advanced, and choose a ComPortNumber in the range 1 - 4
Press Ok, and close all open windows.

Note: if you did many experiments with USB to serial devices, you might need to use a Com-port that Windows says to be in use. If that particular port is not PHYSICALLY connected or in your PC-system, you can override Window's warning, and use that already occupied lower Com. Once BLBF has it's latest ButtLoad-program loaded, you can redo this procedure, and make BLBF use upto Com9 (incl) f.i.
AVRStudio will allow you to use such a high Com-number for AVR-ISP.
So again: a ComPort-number of 4 or lower is ONLY needed to upload ButtLoad software into BLBF, NOT for it's use. Then you can use Com1 - Com9

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Uploading the latest BLBF-software: refer to Dean's procedure
To reset the Butterfly, you might need to unplug it from USB, and plug it back in again. I added a reset-switch for convenience. See "BLBF USB connection diagram.txt" for more info.

=================================================================================

Hints for Linux-users: 

FTDI has a driver-package available on their website for kernels 2.4 and higher.
If you wish to make your USB-BLBF unique, change VID from 0403 (FTDI) to 16C0, and PID from 6001 to 058B. Next add the text "ButtLoad" to the description.
