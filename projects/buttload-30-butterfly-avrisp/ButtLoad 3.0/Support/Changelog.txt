	  * Slight improovement to the OSCCAL calibration, saving a few bytes and adding an acceptable tollerance for faster calibrations
		 
	IN PUBLIC RELEASE 3.1:
	=======================================
	  * Fixed SPI Multi command (bytes for RxBytes and RxStart Byte reversed)

	IN PUBLIC RELEASE 3.0:
	=======================================
	  * Added in audio feedback for several situations
	  * Removed direct dataflash programming code to save space (nobody used it anyway)

	  * Fixed EEPROM storage bug
	  * Fixed incorrect message size on CMD_UNKNOWN return in ProgramManager

	  * Fixed EEPROM programming very slow in all modes
	  * Returned firmware version can now be set up to V2.20
	  * Target busy-wait loops now have timeouts of 100 milliseconds, moved busy-wait to its own routine for size
	  * 921600Hz programming speed is now correct (was actually double that due to a mis-calculation)

	  * Status LED now blinks red when an error occurs
	  * Changes to the RESET MODE option now take effect immediatly after the option is exited
	  * CPU now enters power save mode when awaiting user input, and idle mode when awaiting PC/user input, saving power
	  * Added in ATTR_WARN_UNUSED_RESULT for applicable functions, to reduce coding errors
	  * Fixed logic error in the extended address checking that was preventing >128KB devices from being programmed correctly
	  * Slimmed down LCD driver routines, eliminated unneeded segment buffering
	  * LOGIC level reset now hard drives, rather than uses the AVR's internal pullup
	  * Address loaded in from computer via a union to save space (non-portable, but smaller/faster)

	  * Fixed delays while scrolling a LCD message changed over a loop to wait until the LCD message has finished scrolling
	  * Delay header changed over to a custom one written by Hans-Juergen Heinrichs for more accuracy and flexibility
	  * Added in function descriptions to increase code maintainability

	  * Moved individual settings functions to new Settings.c source file
	  * Added recovery ISP speed mode to repair mis-configured AVR fuses by providing an external clock to the target
	  * Fixed SET FIRM VERSION error that would cause ButtLoad to send the incorrect version back to the PC if changed
	  * Added in Dataflash page to buffer compare, so that the dataflash pages are only updated if the new data differs
	  * Changed LCD refresh rate from 32Hz to 64Hz, to work with the newer Butterflies

	  * ButtTags with lowercase characters are now supported
	  * Red status LED now flashes (indicating error state) when programming fails in PROGRAM AVR mode

	  * Most of the comments removed, leaving only the important ones to clean up the code a bit
	  * VirtualAVRMemMamager now saves the Erase Chip command bytes without wasting EEPROM saving the V2Protocol command
	  * ButtLoad busy "*WAIT*" message is now "*BUSY*"
	  * DATAFLASH STATS mode now checks the dataflash before displaying data, to guard against faulty readings from a damaged/missing chip
	  * Removed redundant extended address checking code from AICB_CMD_READ_FLASH_ISP handler in AVRISP mode
	  * USI word transmit and BUFF_GetBuffByte functions converterted to static inline for speed
	  * Removed unused SPI_TransmitWord function
	  * Added in ERASE NEEDED error for STORAGE MODE, which allowed for the use of the faster Buffer to Flash Without Erase Dataflash command
	  * PROGRAM AVR now checks EEPROM flags to determine if Flash/EEPROM data has been stored rather than calling SM_GetStoredDataSize
	  * Clearing memory now clears the Virtual AVR as well, including inside the startup conditional clearing
	  * SPI speed reduced again to about 114KHz - greater noise immunity, and most of the delay is due to the Dataflash write times
	  * More bounds error fixes to AICB_CMD_SPI_MULTI command
	  * Fixed incorrect return data for AICB_CMD_SPI_MULTI command (thanks to Luke of AVRFreaks)

	  * Removed unused USART_TxString function
	  * EEPROM handling changed over to the (now M169 compatible) AVRLibC routines
	  * USART Rx interrupt moved to RingBuff.c and changed to the contents of the ringbuffer store routine for size/speed
	  * Fixed a few more dataflash programming-related glitches
	  * Moved the timeout setup function code to the TIMEOUT_TIMER_ON() macro
	  * Timeout system now uses Timer2, freeing up Timer1 for auto sleep
	  * Function parameters changed to const (where possible) for robustness
	  * Dataflash busy checking moved to a seperate routine for speed
	  * Added auto-powerdown with user settable timeout

	  * ButtLoad now gives dummy responses to STK500-only parameter GET/SET commands, which the latest AVRStudio seems to like to send for some reason
	  * Turned off the USART U2X bit as it was not needed and reduced the reliability of the serial connection
	  * TagManager now uses a single uint32_t variable to decrease code size and tag scanning time
	  * System clock prescaling removed; buggy and wouldn't reduce power consumption anyway
	  * USI transfer routine re-written in ASM for maximum transfer speed

	  * USI Timer0 compare match routine rewritten in optimised ASM for speed, increased USI max speed value
	  * USI Speed/Compare Value table reordered and blank EEPROM check removed for code size (due to table reorder code still defaults to fastest setting if the EEPROM is blank)
	  * Removed the WriteCollision flag from the USI driver, since the routine waits for completion before exiting anyway
	  * Re-added main menu option for storage info (accidentally removed in 1.2)
