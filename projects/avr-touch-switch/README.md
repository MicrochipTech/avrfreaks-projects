## Summary

This is a project I did last year. Just added the schematic & changed license today (& wrote up an overly worded readme ;)) to make it an easier project to follow.


It's really simple, just add a single 1M resistor to any AVR part & you have a touch switch! It's a bit power hungry as is, the touch sense needs the CPU running near 10mhz and, apart from the sleep between checks & dynamic clocking, I haven't really looked into seeing if that can be improved -- lost the interest to do so when I saw atmel bought quantum, figured I'd see touch on the AVRs pretty soon.
