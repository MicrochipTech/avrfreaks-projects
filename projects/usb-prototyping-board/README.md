## Summary

I am having some of these made for myself and will get some extras for anyone on here that would like one.. I know it could be breadboarded but I expect there sre those here that can't or don't want to.  

I have laid the board out so that you have 3 options to develop various projects using Tiny45, Tiny2313 (90S2313)or Mega 8/48 etc. The core of the board design is based on the AVR309 application note for the 90S2313, but with the two extra processors.There is the option to power this board at 5V or 3V3, with a link to select 5V operation.There are various breakout points for further development, pin headers and leds. If you want one, they are Â£10 each including p&p....
