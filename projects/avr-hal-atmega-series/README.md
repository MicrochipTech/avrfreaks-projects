## Summary

hello guys this is my first post here i really like this community it is very helpful


i am trying to make a full HDL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) for AVR atmega series to become a place for any one that want to use it 


i am starting now with UART library that has the following feature 


- complete receive and transmit string over Uart


- the project is easy to ported to any atmega series but the development currently under atmega32 and will be easily ported to any AVR MCU later on
