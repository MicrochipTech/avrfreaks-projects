## Summary

High speed FT2232H USB2 chip version supported.  

ATXMEGA128A1 JTAG ONLINE DEBUG AVRStudio4 support !


This is embedded JTAG ICE or SPI interface. SPI or JTAG ICE Is done by the easiest way as is possible - to integrate ICE JTAG and debug HW as well as SPI HW into your target !  

NO DOWNLOADER ON TARGET ! IN SYSTEM ONLINE DEBUG WITH AVRSTUDIO !


Full debug support for lot of chips targets (ATXMEGA128, ATMEGA16 , ATMEGA32 , ATMEGA128, ATMEGA2561, and lot of others versions ...) !  

Support also ATtiny13,ATmega16,88,48,168,32,128,2561 targets with SPI interface 


There is only one standart FT2232 USB chip, which is connected to JTAG pins or SPI pins of your target AVR8 processor. This FT2232 is also used for standart serial communication. All job is done on your PC , which emulates JTAG interface or SPI interface via FT2232. This allows you to debug your application from AVRStudio, control fuses, memory lock bits and software downloading by one exe programm at your PC, via USB, without any external HW necesserity. The performance is now excellent. You can use this as initial tool for download one of "bootloader" routines into new , "clean" AVR for first time as weel as for standart flash upload or debug IN TARGET SYSTEM procedure.
