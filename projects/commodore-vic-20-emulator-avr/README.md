## Summary

EDIT: woops, the pics and 'files' links actually work now.


This Project emulates the commodore VIC-20 computer (Predecessor to the commodre 64).  

The main code is to emulate the 6502 CPU. There is also VIC-20 specific hardware emulation.  

The emulator can boot up the original Kernel and Basic ROMs and will run the commodore Basic language (default boot with no external cartridge inserted)  

It will soon be able to play downloaded VIC-20 games, which will be 'uploaded' into the emulator from flash memory.


An AVR running at 16MHZ will emulate at approximatly 1.5-2 times the speed of the original computer
