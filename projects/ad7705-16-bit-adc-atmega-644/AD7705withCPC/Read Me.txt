A Dual Channel Bench PSU is used to apply the variable voltage to Ain1(+)(CH1)
and also  the 5volt supply (CH2) with a common ground.

The 2.5volt reference is created with a potential divider using two
200ohm resiters using the 5v supply line and ground. 

The crystal for the ADC is 2.4576MHZ with two 23pF caps on each leg to ground

The crystal for the Atmega644 is 8MHZ with two 23pF caps on each leg to ground

To use AIN2 of the AD7705:
ldi 	data,0x39				;Tells com register of AD7705 it is going to be read from 
	rcall 	SPI_Transfer
	rcall 	lcd_delay50us

instead of 
ldi 	data,0x38				;Tells com register of AD7705 it is going to be read from 
	rcall 	SPI_Transfer
	rcall 	lcd_delay50us

Then AIN2(+) will be the input referenced to AIN2(-) which also 
needs to be 2.5v. This is clear on the data sheet.

The AD7705 is setup in bipolar mode with a Gain of 1 and as stated
a reference voltage of 2.5volts.  This accomodates analogue inputs 
between 0 and 5 volts.
