# VGA output from mega16

Uploaded by MohitAgarwal on 2011-07-07 02:50:00 (rating 0 out of 5)

## Summary

I have made a simple VGA library for output on VGA/LCD monitors. It is much like GLCD, like for ex. you want to display a rectangle .. then just call rect function included in my library and give coordinated to it, with a 3 bit colour code. Coordinated can be variable.


As you know, we have very less memory in mega16 to store frame data to be displayed, I have interfaced SRAM through parallel connections to store whole data frame.  

 I have also developed a game and image displayer through this library.  

I will post their links soon.If anyone wants to discuss with me regarding this project or wants to develop this project to new height, Contact me.  

Just message me in this site.. and i'll contact you..

Special Thanks to "Serasidis Vasilis" whose article named AVR-VGA and demo code helped a lot.


Upload file function is not working.
