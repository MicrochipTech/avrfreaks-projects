## Summary

The system will record and transmit binary waveforms. IR or RF modules can be added according to the application.  

System uses mega8515 operating at 8Mhz.  

It can be used to record a number of different waveforms keeping each in seperate place and transmit whichever you like.  

hence it can be used to control your tv,vcd and even open your neighbour's garage doors or car provided they use the same code each time.
