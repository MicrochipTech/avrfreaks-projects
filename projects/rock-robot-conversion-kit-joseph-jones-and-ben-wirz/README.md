## Summary

"The Robot Conversion Kit, RoCK, is an electronic module that makes it easy to convert an RC car into an autonomous robot. We introduced RoCK, our entry in Circuit Cellar’s Design Logic 2001 contest, in earlier issues where we discussed RoCK’s specifications and circuitry. In this issue we describe RoCK’s behavior-based programming scheme. Behavior-based programming is the modern robot control technique that gives RoCK much of its muscle and versatility." - Joseph Jones and Ben Wirz


Joseph Jones has kindly agreed to release the documents and the source code to avr freaks with the following caveats


"I've attached the code but please be advised, there was never an absolutely final version. Also, there is no guarantee that the supplied code is fully consistent with the hardware described in the articles. I used the ICC AVR compiler from ImageCraft to compile the code--probably changes would be required to make the code work with the current version of that compiler. But with those caveats, enjoy!" - Joseph Jones
