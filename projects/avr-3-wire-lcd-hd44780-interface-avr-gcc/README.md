## Summary

A simple AVR 3-wire interface to an HD44780-based LCD display. This sample (and the only test so far) uses an ATmega8 mpu and a PC-1202A LCD display, however, it should work with other mpu/LCDs. Sources and schematic included (GPL).


The schematic is based on Stefan Heinzmann's PIC12C508 3-wire Interface. The code is written from scratch and is minimal. Complete details and a photo of the project on my breadboard are on my website at [http://www.micahcarrick.com/v2/c...](http://www.micahcarrick.com/v2/content/view/27/21/)
