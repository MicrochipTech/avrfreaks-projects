## Summary

The SPI2CF project was developed around the spi2cf chip. This chip is based on a cheap (~$2) Xilinx CPLD that translates between a SPI interface and a compact flash (CF) interface. It thus allows to drive a CF WLAN card using as few as four pins at the AVR and at the same time reducing the complexity of CF interfacing on the AVR. The latest version allows to clock the SPI at >8Mhz, thus allowing it to interface to a 16Mhz AVR resulting in a simple, fast and reliable WLAN interface for the AVR.


The spi2cf projects is based on the uip-1.0 embedded TCP/IP stack and the demo application features a WLAN webserver demo.
