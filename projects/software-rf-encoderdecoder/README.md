## Summary

This project is an encoder/decoder for cheap RF modules  

specifically the 434MHz ones. It is written entirely in assembly.  

You can connect the avr directly to the RF modules. This  

system is very reliable.


The timing is tight and carefully calibrated to use only a 3.6864MHz clock. This encoder/decoder pair works with 8 bit data, and an 8 bit address. 


Please read the "readthis.txt" file for full details.


If you have any questions, or want to offer some improvements to the code,please message me here on avrfreaks.
