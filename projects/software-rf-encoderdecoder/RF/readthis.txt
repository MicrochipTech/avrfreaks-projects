8 bit Software RF encoder/decoder for avr

This project is an encoder/decoder for cheap RF modules
specifically the 434MHz ones.

Both the receiver & transmitter code are written for an attiny2313 (tested & working)
or a AT90S2313(tested & working).

There are few calls in the code to allow it to work on devices without sram. 
For this code, I only had an old AT90S1200 to test.It should work with others,
probably the attiny11,attiny12,attiny15 maybe?

The code can easily be modified for other avr's
as long as the external crystal is not changed. The timing is tight and carefully 
calibrated to use only a 3.6864MHz clock. If it doesn't work when using an attiny2313,
you didn't program the fuses correctly!

I needed to send a short packet to a nearby device on my property.
There are many problems using the cheap modules without some sort
or encoding/decoding. The encoders available (if you can find any in stock)
only work for 4 bit data. 

This encoder/decoder works with 8 bit data, and an 8 bit address.
The address must be the same in both transmitter and receiver, or the 
commands will be rejected. You can edit the address (addr) and command (cmd) in the
source code.

Sorry, no schematic. Just read the source code for the pinout. Connect the avr directly to the transmitter or the receiver. (only two pins on the transmitter and 3 pins on the receiver). One thing I did to increase range was to power the RF transmitter with 12 Volts while powering the transmitter's encoder with 5 volts.

This system is currently in use and has been for over 1 year. It works very well at over 300 feet distance between the transmitter and receiver.

If you have any questions, or want to offer some improvements to the code,
please message me on avrfreaks.
