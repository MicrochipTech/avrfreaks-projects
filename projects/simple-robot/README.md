## Summary

This is the full schematics and code for a simple 2-motor robot using infrared "eyes" to avoid (or attack) obstacles. It is based on a state machine, and contains code for UART driving, simple motor control, and a general framework for slotting in code modules so that the resulting code is modular and readable.
