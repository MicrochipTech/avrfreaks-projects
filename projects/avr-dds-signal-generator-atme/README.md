## Summary

AVR DDS signal generator uses R-2R digital to analog (DAC) converter This is a simplest solution where resistors are connected in a ladder. AThis is a first trimmed version of AVR controlled generator. It has half of working functionality in many cases this can be enough. Main signals are generated and can be controlled. Generator generates signals as they are â€“ directly from DAC. There is no variable gain regulation. Second version is goingto be more complete with Power aplifier and feedback control.
