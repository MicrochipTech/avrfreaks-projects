## Summary

Plate Copier / Plate Maker  

Microcontroller : ATMEL ATMEGA8535  

Language : CodeVision-AVR


This was my final project (thesis). I made a device which can be used to expose a positive plate automatically using two very bright metal-halide lamps in a vacuum box. It can be used to expose many kinds of positive plates (RRC, Japan, etc) with maximum size of 80x60cm.
