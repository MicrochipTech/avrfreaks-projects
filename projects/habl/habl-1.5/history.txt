Can receive xmodem,
Need to figure out how to put this code into the bootloader section of the AVR.

Small cleanup, functionality is the same.

Autoboot will now expect 5 Esc characters to
avoid going inte xmodem due to other traffic.

Will now expect exactly 5 Esc characters to avoid
entering xmodem mode by mistake or due to noise.
