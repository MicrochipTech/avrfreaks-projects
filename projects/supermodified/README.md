## Summary

This project includes:  

-Mechanical mods to allow continuous rotation.  

-Mechanical mods to fit an absolute / incremental 12-bit encoder.  

-Electronics schematics for PCBs  

-Source code for the AVR Microcontroller


The Supermmodified servo is able to:  

-Perform velocity control  

-Perform position control (with advanced motion profiles)  

-Communicate via i2c, 5 or 3.3 V uart, RS485, PPM, as well as standard RC-servo PWM interface  

-Control 4 Digital I/Os and read 4 analog inputs  

-Provide feedback for the motor position and velocity  

-Provide feedback for the motor current (only for the 5Amp version PCB)
