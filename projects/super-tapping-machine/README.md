## Summary

The Super Tapper is a machine I developed for the semi-automated tapping of M2-M5 threads in heat-sinks and brackets. It combines a converted bench drill with a lubricant pump, DC motor drive and optical depth encoder to create a depth sensitive bi-directional tapping head. A MEGA32 controls a 20Amp H Bridge driver with PWM and feedback is monitored from the current sensing resistor, optical depth encoder and spinal speed detector. The user plunges the tap into the work piece at which time the tapping head turns forward accompanied by a squirt of lubricant. As the tap reaches a preset depth, it reverses out of the hole and stops ready for the next hole. We can tap about 12 holes a minute with very few breakages, at the fraction of the cost of a CNC mill.
