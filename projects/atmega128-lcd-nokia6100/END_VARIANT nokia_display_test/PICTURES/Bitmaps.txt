For easy bitmaps loading - connect yampp7 to USB, power on,
and run "upload.bat" file. Before this, setup the COM port number
inside "upload.bat" file. Now the ylink create "Datas.bin" file
from set of bitmaps, and download it to yampp.

In some cases you must copy the "lcd_layout.h" file provided inside
skin folder to firmware folder, then recompile and reload firmware.

Special Icon00 layout:

This is special bitmap for providing way to setup colors for
objects that yampp display dynamically thus texts and bars.
Any object have two colors: background and foreground. Background
color should be the same as colour used in background bitmap at 
designed position.

Note: 
All x, y positions and objects numbers is counting from 0 to 15.

First row of this bitmap define background color of each 16 avaliable
objects, pixel by pixel (pixel color at x=0 and y=0 mean background
color of object0, x=1,y=0 -> object1 ect.)

Second row define foreground color of each 16 avaliable elements

Thrid row define colors of volume and progress bars. 
x=0,y=2 -> playing progressbar background color
x=1,y=2 -> playing progressbar foreground color
x=2,y=2 -> volume bar background color
x=3,y=2 -> volume bar foreground color 
x=4,y=2 -> power off bar background color
x=5,y=2 -> power off bar foreground color
x=6,y=2 -> contrast value bar background color
x=7,y=2 -> contrast value bar foreground color
