## Summary

The ÂµC has at least 4 ADC-Channels but as many as possible, these channels be as fast as possible. The results and values will transmit via RS232 and later via USB to an Windows 7 (64bit) computer. The coding language of the evaluation unit isn't fixed. I had thought about Matlab, Java, VB or simply C.


This is the description of the basic version. Additions are possible.
