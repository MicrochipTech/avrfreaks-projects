## Summary

Super Wack Bros. is a super wack, open source, two-player, head-to-head whack-a-mole game and my entry for a microcontroller competition. The game is played on a Hall Research Technologies KP-2B keypad that has been retrofitted with an ATtiny2313.


The players each have to guard four mole holes, and win by getting ahead of their opponent by reacting the fastest. The game can use the optional speaker to play sound effects and in-game music inspired by music from the classic Dig-Dug game. As the game progresses the game play and music speed-up, increasing the tension.

The firmware uses Kartman's cooperative multitasking framework from his fine tutorial referenced here: [https://www.avrfreaks.net/index.p...](https://www.avrfreaks.net/index.php?name=PNphpBB2&file=viewtopic&t=95490)
