## Summary

This project was built to read magnetic cards into the PC by emulating the keyboard. Two versions are included. 1st emulates (for the most part anyway) a ps2 keyboard to type the characters to the screen and the other uses the parallel port. Why didn't I just use the parr. port directly you ask? 'cause it wouldn't need an avr then :)
