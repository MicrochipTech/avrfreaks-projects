## Summary

I've used the ELM322 but I'd love to be able to use Amtel chips. decided on avr instead of pic and I'm trying to stay with one.. lol I've been working on my own with arduino but trying to work on something like this for awhile.. all I have is a parallel programmer right now and I'm trying to figure out makefile's and whatever it is I need to program the atmega8's I have with this code..
