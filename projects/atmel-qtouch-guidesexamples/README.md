## Summary

My own collection of Guides and Examples for QTouch and QMatrix ICs, and TLib/QTLib (Atmel QTouch library). 


You can use these as a quick start into Atmel Capacitive Touch, but be sure to also check the more detailed official Touch documents on the Atmel Website, and also the Atmel Touch Forum.
