This directory contains a USB bootloader for ATmega devices.  It
definitely works on AT90USB1287, is likely to work on ATmega32U4, and
should be close for other USB chips too.  It's bare-bones: it
enumerates as VID 0x16c0, PID 0x0497 (no description strings, etc).
One configuration, no endpoints (except, of course, EP0).  Apart from
GET_DESCRIPTOR and SET_ADDRESS commands, the code only handles IN and
OUT transactions of Vendor, Device mode.  On an IN transaction, the
code executes LPM (or ELPM) from the address in wIndex.  SPMCSR is
loaded with bRequest, so you can use this transaction to read Fuses,
Lock bits, Signature bits, etc (as well as ordinary Flash).  OUT
transactions do SPM at the wIndex address, then SPM to write to
Flash.  The host-side MUST figure out the appropriate page size &
boundaries, because the AVR side doesn't.

The possibly unusual, and definitely useful, part about this
bootloader is that it fits in 256 words (512 bytes).  This is the
smallest configurable boot block size on some of the Atmel USB
processors.
