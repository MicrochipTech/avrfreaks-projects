This directory contains a Qt-based bootloader-driver for the usbl
Atmel USB bootloader.  It's only set up for AT90USB1287s now, but
could be extended pretty easily (though tediously).  I'm not a Qt
programmer, so there's doubtless better ways to do everything.

This has only been tested on 64-bit Linux (Ubuntu 9.04) with
usblib-1.0.  You'll also need an avr-capable objdump on your PATH if
you want the disassembly to work right.
