## Summary

This is my first project using AVR MCU. I connected MCP9700 thermistor to the ADC of AVRatmega32 MCU. Using AVR studio 4 I wrote a program to read the value of the ADC and calculate the temperature. The results are shown on two 7\_segment displays. The circuit is taking +4.5v from the source which is almost higher than the limit of the LEDs of the 7 segment. That is why you see that the 7 segments are very bright in the attached picture. There no enough space on this board to connect resistors but I think it is ok since the circuit worked fine.
