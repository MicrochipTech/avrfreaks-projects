## Summary

If you ever read Dune (better yet The Butlerian Jihad) you might already know what this is - if you didn't then read on. The GloGlobe was a device that could be tuned to any color in the visible spectrum and created it's own suspensor field which provided the user with soft interior lighting that didn't need to be physically mounted anywhere (because it just floated wherever you put it). My GloGlobe unfortunately doesn't levitate and that is beyond the scope of this project so it never will levitate I'm afraid.
