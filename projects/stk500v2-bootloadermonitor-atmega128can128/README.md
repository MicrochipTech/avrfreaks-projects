## Summary

The code is designed to be either bootloader and hardware monitor.  

It is provided especially to work with MB-128/MB-128-USBCAN proto-boards. Most of STK500 functions is working including flash/eeprom programming/reading, fuses/locks/signature/parameters reading etc. Bootloader can communicate with AVR Studio using UART0/UART1 and on-board FT232 USB chip.  

Monitor functions allows to on-line dump/modify Flash/RAM/EEPROM content and set/display RTC.  

This code should work as well ( with limited features ) on all atmega's with bootloader support.
