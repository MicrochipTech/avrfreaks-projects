## Summary

Our project â€˜Speed Measurement using AVR ATMEGA16â€™ is basically a method of measuring speed of propellers.Here we are using microcontroller ATMEGA16 for this purpose.It is a 8 bit microcontroller with a processing speed of 16 MIPS and runs at 16 MHZ .


It measures the speed without any physical contact with propeller.This measurement is based on measuring no of pulses received using sensors.Sensors used are IR txr-rxr pair.Tsop sensors can also be used for better accuracy of result.IR photo diode sends ir rays at moving propeller and at the propeller we are using a thin or fine white strip which reflects the IR rays once on each rotation.It can speed upto 90k RPM.
