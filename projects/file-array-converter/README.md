## Summary

oddly enough, find it online I could not. Whether the search can not, then there is a problem nobody cares, or even that prevented ... Well, what should we build a house? draw - we shall live! So I went and wrote himself a utility. 


I called it modestly D2T, ie Data to Text converter - the converter to text. 


Utility runs in console mode - this is on me is beginning to affect the use of various GNU-software, and they come from all the Linux, where the command line is a mother. 


The utility already has quite a few possibilities:  

Read any file, interpreting it as binary bytes (raw binary format)  

Reads a file in Intel HEX (standard for all programmers)  

Can handle any number of files on a mask  

Can create an array of formats adopted for C programs, Pascal, and assembler  

Can not handle all the data in the file, but only the selected area  

Can output the result of directly to the console  

Can create an array of bytes, the 16-bit words and 32-bit words  

Can represent data in binary, octal, decimal (signed or not) and hexadecimal  

Has additional capabilities to change the format of the array design
