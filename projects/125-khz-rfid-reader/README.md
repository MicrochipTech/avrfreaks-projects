## Summary

This 125kHz RFID reader uses an ATtiny13 micro-controller clocked with internal RC oscillator at 9.6 MHz. No special chip, such as EM4095, is used.  

The ATtiny13 reads the 10-digit serial number of RFID Tags and outputs the number through serial port (TTL) using 2400 bps (bits per second).
