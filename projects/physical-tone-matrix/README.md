## Summary

I wanted to make a physical version of Andre Michelle's Tone Matrix flash applet ([http://lab.andre-michelle.com/to...](http://lab.andre-michelle.com/tonematrix)) as a toy for my kids to play with. I made a double-sided PCB, soldered an ATmega328, 256 LEDs and a few other parts, made a matrix of touch switches out of wire and acrylic, and put it all in a box. I also wrote all the software - the timing-critical parts as assembly code and the rest as C code. I used an Arduino as an in-circuit programmer. Full details including photos, videos, source and schematics are at [http://www.reenigne.org/blog/phy...](http://www.reenigne.org/blog/physical-tone-matrix) .
