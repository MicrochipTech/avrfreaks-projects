## Summary

This is a small board designed to assist development of low level software and kernel on cheap commodity development boards. It provides control and power consumption monitoring of two USB lines and a generic low voltage DC line. It also provides two isolated channels to simulate switch pressure, such as power/recovery buttons, and allows to program complex on/off sequences.


A Linux userspace application is provided to be used in custom scripts.
