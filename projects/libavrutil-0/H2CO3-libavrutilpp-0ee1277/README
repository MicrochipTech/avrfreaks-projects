Libavrutil++ is a C++ library for the AVR platform. Basically, it is an object-oriented convenience wrapper around libavrutil, for developers who prefer using C++/OO instead of the (somewhat more efficient) procedural C API.

Please note that libavrutil++ depends on libavrutil, so download and install it if you haven't done it yet.

The documentation structure, the build system and genproj, and the environmental requirements (most notably the GNU AVR toolchain) are the same as that of libavrutil.

Notice: the name "libavr++" is preferred over "libavrpp", the Git repository's name is only libavrpp due to the capabilities of Git. You can preserve the preferred name during cloning the repository using the following command:

git clone git://github.com/H2CO3/libavrutilpp.git libavrutil++
