## Summary

Yes, if you recently bought an ATMEGA2560 you might find it hard to start using it, SO, i've decided to post a sample code to everything you need to program it using USART + PWM + ADC.


To compile it:  

1-Create a new project  

2-Paste the provided code  

3-Select ATMEGA2560 device for compiler  

4-Build it!


To burn it on the ATMEGA2560:  

1-Connect the STK600 Board on your AVRStudio5  

2-UpgradeIt  

3-Connect by AVR Programming tool on AVRStudio5  

4-Select device & board  

5-Configure plattform to 3.3volt & 8MHz  

6-Upload your resulting ELF File selecting at AVR Programming window.


It's quite easy to adapt to your own uController =)


Enjoy!!
