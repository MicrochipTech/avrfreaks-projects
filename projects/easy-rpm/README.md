# Easy RPM

## Summary

The RPM counter is a pretty funny thing. It uses an optical sensor to measure the RPM. However the sensor that I uses is not the fork type but the type that sends out IR light and then the object that you measure reflects the light back into the sensor.  

This way its easy to measure on almost everything. Your drilling machine, the fan in your computer or like me the RPM on my remote controlled helicopters head rotor (while actually hovering above ground).  

With this kind of sensor you don't have to place the sensor into the moving object, it's enough to point the light beam onto the target.
