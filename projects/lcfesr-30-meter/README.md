# LCFesR 3.0 meter

## Summary

LCFesR 3.0 unit is a precise, wide range meter that can measure inductivity, capacity, frequency and equivalent series resistance of a capacitor in-circuit, which can be easily built with homemade 1- or 2-sided PCB and available electronic components.


During a project of my hobbies (building a dog/cat alarm unit) I had to check the value of an inductivity of a little transformer that I winded, but I could not because I had no such meter. So I tried to build an inductivity/capacity/frequency (shortly LCF) meter for my own use, which followed by the capability of measuring the Equivalent Series Resistance (shortly ESR) of capacitor inside an electronic circuit.


On the internet I found formulas of L and C calculations with the help of building LC and RC oscillator circuits around CMOS IC inverters and some information about measuring ESR. I used these information as a theory to begin to make my new instrument that use AVR ATMega8-16PU processor. It took a lot of works to design, redesign the hardware, write, test and rewrite the software.
