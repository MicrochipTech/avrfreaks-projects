## Summary

Part of final semester project. More details available at [http://autolightcontrol.googlepa...](http://autolightcontrol.googlepages.com) including full code, complete report, photos and video. 


The system developed is an automated lighting control system demonstrated using a model room of 24in x 16in x 24in. An Atmel AtMega32L 8bit microcontroller is used for control purpose. A 12V, 2.5A stepper motor is used to interface the microcontroller with the blinds to control light flow into the room. A user pushbutton and switch interface is also provided to choose the type of lamp to be dimmed and also to over-ride automatic operation and use manual pushbutton controls to increase or decrease brightness and to open or close blinds. Dimming is achieved by phase control method using a triac.


Energy is essential to life but with rising fuel and energy costs, energy conservation has become an absolute necessity. Starting with the incandescent lamp to HID and xenon lamps, illumination technology has come a long way. But lamp life extension still plays a major role. The aim of this project is to integrate energy conservation and lamp life extension by  

providing control solutions using a microcontroller so as to reduce energy costs and also extend lamp life.


The fully functional system automatically controls the light in a room based on room occupancy, lighting conditions and user objectives by controlling the intensity of lighting inside and the amount of external light coming into the room. This is done by controlling the opening of the blinds and the dimming of the lamp inside. The innovative automatic mode operates under the energy saving strategy. Even under varying light intensity outside (sunlight), the optimum brightness level is maintained under the energy saving objective.


Phase control using manual potentiometer is a cheap and handy way of dimming of Incandescent Lamps (GLS). But to incorporate energy saving and to make way for automated systems this cannot be used. Hence a dimmer circuitry which can be interfaced with any microcontroller or microprocessor and which can thus be used in automated systems and to  

provide control solutions is discussed within this project.


Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFL) even though have electronic ballasts cannot be used with normal potentiometer based dimmers because of the flickering aspect under CFL dimming. But using the system hence discussed flickering can be eliminated and a satisfying dimming  

response can be achieved even using a CFL.


The system designed can be a self-configuring lighting control system solution, which can be easily incorporated into homes, offices etc for energy saving as well as for automation purposes.


Using the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) of the AtMega32L, several microcontrollers could be connected in Master-Slave mode for high-speed synchronous data transfer between them. This could be used if control solutions for the whole building or several rooms are required.


Using the Universal Synchronous and Asynchronous serial Receiver and Transmitter (USART) of the AtMega32L, the system could be connected to laptops and PCâ€™s for modification or reprogramming the system to suit user needs and requirements.
